    <p>Unlicensed medicines are available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers and specialist-importing companies; the MHRA maintains a register of these companies at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/cdslke\">tinyurl.com/cdslke</xref>.</p>
    <p>Licensed <b>hospital manufacturing units</b> also manufacture ‘special-order’ products as unlicensed medicines, the principal NHS units are listed below. A database (<i>Pro-File</i>; <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.pro-file.nhs.uk\">www.pro-file.nhs.uk</xref>) provides information on medicines manufactured in the NHS; access is restricted to NHS pharmacy staff.</p>
    <p>The Association of Pharmaceutical Specials Manufacturers may also be able to provide further information about commercial companies (<xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.apsm-uk.com\">www.apsm-uk.com</xref>).</p>
    <p>The MHRA recommends that an unlicensed medicine should only be used when a patient has special requirements that cannot be met by use of a licensed medicine.</p>
    <p>As well as being available direct from the hospital manufacturer(s) concerned, many NHS-manufactured Specials may be bought from the Oxford Pharmacy Store, owned and operated by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust.</p>

Licensed hospital manufacturing units also manufacture ‘special-order’ products as unlicensed medicines, the principal NHS units are listed below. A database (Pro-File; www.pro-file.nhs.uk) provides information on medicines manufactured in the NHS; access is restricted to NHS pharmacy staff.

The Association of Pharmaceutical Specials Manufacturers may also be able to provide further information about commercial companies (www.apsm-uk.com).

The MHRA recommends that an unlicensed medicine should only be used when a patient has special requirements that cannot be met by use of a licensed medicine.

As well as being available direct from the hospital manufacturer(s) concerned, many NHS-manufactured Specials may be bought from the Oxford Pharmacy Store, owned and operated by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual. Careful assessment of symptoms and needs of the patient should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team.</p>
    <p>Specialist palliative care is available in most areas as day hospice care, home-care teams (often known as Macmillan teams), in-patient hospice care, and hospital teams. Many acute hospitals and teaching centres now have consultative, hospital-based teams.</p>
    <p>Hospice care of terminally ill patients has shown the importance of symptom control and psychosocial support of the patient and family. Families should be included in the care of the patient if they wish.</p>
    <p>Many patients wish to remain at home with their families. Although some families may at first be afraid of caring for the patient at home, support can be provided by community nursing services, social services, voluntary agencies and hospices together with the general practitioner. The family may be reassured by the knowledge that the patient will be admitted to a hospital or hospice if the family cannot cope.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Drug treatment</p>
      <p>The number of drugs should be as few as possible, for even the taking of medicine may be an effort. Oral medication is usually satisfactory unless there is severe nausea and vomiting, dysphagia, weakness, or coma, when parenteral medication may be necessary.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Pain</p>
    <p>Pain management in palliative care is focused on achieving control of pain by administering the right drug in the right dose at the right time. Analgesics can be divided into three broad classes: non-opioid (<xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref>, NSAID), opioid (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/codeine-phosphate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP460\">codeine phosphate</xref> ‘weak’, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> ‘strong’) and adjuvant (e.g. antidepressants, antiepileptics). Drugs from the different classes are used alone or in combination according to the type of pain and response to treatment. Analgesics are more effective in preventing pain than in the relief of established pain; it is important that they are given regularly.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">Paracetamol</xref> or a <b>NSAID</b> given regularly will often be sufficient to manage mild pain. If non-opioid analgesics alone are not sufficient, then an opioid analgesic alone or in combination with a non-opioid analgesic at an adequate dosage, may be helpful in the control of moderate pain. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/codeine-phosphate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP460\">Codeine phosphate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tramadol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2795\">tramadol hydrochloride</xref> can be considered for moderate pain. If these preparations do not control the pain then <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> is the most useful opioid analgesic. Alternatives to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref>, including transdermal <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/buprenorphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2680\">buprenorphine</xref>, transdermal <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fentanyl.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2713\">fentanyl</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydromorphone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2727\">hydromorphone hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methadone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2065\">methadone hydrochloride</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/oxycodone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2766\">oxycodone hydrochloride</xref>, should be initiated by those with experience in palliative care. Initiation of an opioid analgesic should not be delayed by concern over a theoretical likelihood of psychological dependence (addiction).</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Bone metastases</p>
      <p>In addition to the above approach, radiotherapy, <b>bisphosphonates</b>, and radioactive isotopes of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/strontium-ranelate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4695\">strontium ranelate</xref> (<i>Metastron</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> available from GE Healthcare) may be useful for pain due to bone metastases.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Neuropathic pain</p>
      <p>Patients with <b>neuropathic pain</b> may benefit from a trial of a tricyclic antidepressant. An antiepileptic may be added or substituted if pain persists; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/gabapentin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2930\">gabapentin</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pregabalin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2933\">pregabalin</xref> are licensed for neuropathic pain. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ketamine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8518\">Ketamine</xref> is sometimes used under specialist supervision for neuropathic pain that responds poorly to opioid analgesics. Pain due to nerve compression may be reduced by a corticosteroid such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">dexamethasone</xref>, which reduces oedema around the tumour, thus reducing compression. Nerve blocks or regional anaesthesia techniques (including the use of epidural and intrathecal catheters) can be considered when pain is localised to a specific area.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Pain management with opioids</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Oral route</p>
      <p>Treatment with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> is given by mouth as immediate-release or modified-release preparations. During the titration phase the initial dose is based on the previous medication used, the severity of the pain, and other factors such as presence of renal impairment, increasing age, or frailty. The dose is given either as an immediate-release preparation 4-hourly or as a modified- release preparation 12-hourly, in addition to rescue doses.</p>
      <p>If pain occurs between regular doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> (‘breakthrough pain’), an additional dose (‘rescue dose’) of immediate-release <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> should be given. An additional dose should also be given 30 minutes before an activity that causes pain, such as wound dressing. The standard dose of a strong opioid for breakthrough pain is usually one-tenth to one-sixth of the regular 24-hour dose, repeated every 2–4 hours as required (up to hourly may be needed if pain is severe or in the last days of life). Review pain management if rescue analgesic is required frequently (twice daily or more). Each patient should be assessed on an individual basis. Formulations of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fentanyl.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2713\">fentanyl</xref> that are administered nasally, buccally or sublingually are also licensed for breakthrough pain.</p>
      <p>When adjusting the dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref>, the number of rescue doses required and the response to them should be taken into account; increments of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> should not exceed one-third to one-half of the total daily dose every 24 hours. Thereafter, the dose should be adjusted with careful assessment of the pain, and the use of adjuvant analgesics should also be considered. Upward titration of the dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> stops when either the pain is relieved or unacceptable adverse effects occur, after which it is necessary to consider alternative measures.</p>
      <p>Morphine immediate-release 30mg 4-hourly (or modified- release 100 mg 12-hourly) is usually adequate for most patients; some patients require morphine immediate- release up to 200mg 4-hourly (or modified-release 600 mg 12-hourly), occasionally more is needed.</p>
      <p>Once their pain is controlled, patients started on 4-hourly immediate-release <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> can be transferred to the same total 24-hour dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> given as the modified-release preparation for 12-hourly or 24-hourly administration. The first dose of the modified-release preparation is given with, or within 4 hours of, the last dose of the immediate-release preparation. For preparations suitable for 12-hourly or 24-hourly administration see modified-release preparations under <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref>. Increments should be made to the dose, not to the frequency of administration. The patient must be monitored closely for efficacy and side-effects, particularly constipation, and nausea and vomiting. A suitable laxative should be prescribed routinely.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/oxycodone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2766\">Oxycodone hydrochloride</xref> can be used in patients who require an opioid but cannot tolerate <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref>. If the patient is already receiving an opioid, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/oxycodone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2766\">oxycodone hydrochloride</xref> should be started at a dose equivalent to the current analgesic (see below). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/oxycodone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2766\">Oxycodone hydrochloride</xref> immediate-release preparations can be given for breakthrough pain.</p>

      <p>The equivalent parenteral dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> (subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous) is about half of the oral dose. If the patient becomes unable to swallow, generally <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> is administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion (for details, see Continuous Subcutaneous Infusions below). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2699\">Diamorphine hydrochloride</xref> is sometimes preferred, because being more soluble, it can be given in a smaller volume. The equivalent subcutaneous dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2699\">diamorphine hydrochloride</xref> is about one-third of the oral dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref>.</p>
      <p>If the patient can resume taking medicines by mouth, then oral <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> may be substituted for subcutaneous infusion of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2699\">diamorphine hydrochloride</xref>, see table above of approximate equivalent doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2699\">diamorphine hydrochloride</xref>.

Prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the correct use of transdermal preparations, see under <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/buprenorphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2680\">buprenorphine</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fentanyl.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2713\">fentanyl</xref> (inappropriate use has caused fatalities). Immediate-release <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> can be given for breakthrough pain.</p>
      <p>The following 24-hour oral doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> are considered to be <i>approximately</i> equivalent to the <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/buprenorphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2680\">buprenorphine</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fentanyl.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2713\">fentanyl</xref> patches shown, however when switching due to possible opioid-induced hyperalgesia, reduce the calculated equivalent dose of the new opioid by one-quarter to one-half.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Nausea and vomiting</p>
      <p>Nausea and vomiting are common in patients with advanced cancer. Ideally, the cause should be determined before treatment with an antiemetic is started. A prokinetic antiemetic may be a preferred choice for first-line therapy.</p>
      <p>Nausea and vomiting may occur with opioid therapy particularly in the initial stages but can be prevented by giving an antiemetic such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/haloperidol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2226\">haloperidol</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoclopramide-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2547\">metoclopramide hydrochloride</xref>. An antiemetic is usually necessary only for the first 4 or 5 days and therefore combined preparations containing an opioid with an antiemetic are not recommended because they lead to unnecessary antiemetic therapy (and associated side-effects when used long-term).</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoclopramide-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2547\">Metoclopramide hydrochloride</xref> has a prokinetic action and is used by mouth for nausea and vomiting associated with gastritis, gastric stasis, and functional bowel obstruction.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Continuous subcutaneous infusions</p>
    <p>Although drugs can usually be administered <i>by mouth</i> to control the symptoms of advanced cancer, the parenteral route may sometimes be necessary. Repeated administration of <i>intramuscular injections</i> can be difficult in a cachectic patient. This has led to the use of portable continuous infusion devices, such as syringe drivers, to give a <i>continuous subcutaneous infusion</i>, which can provide good control of symptoms with little discomfort or inconvenience to the patient.</p>
    <p>Indications for the <b>parenteral route</b> are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the patient is unable to take medicines by mouth owing to <i>nausea and vomiting</i>, <i>dysphagia</i>, <i>severe weakness</i>, or <i>coma</i></li>
      <li>there is <i>malignant bowel obstruction</i> in patients for whom further surgery is inappropriate (avoiding the need for an intravenous infusion or for insertion of a nasogastric tube)</li>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Mixing and compatibility</p>
      <p>The general principle that injections should be given into separate sites (and should not be mixed) does not apply to the use of syringe drivers in palliative care. Provided that there is evidence of compatibility, selected injections can be mixed in syringe drivers. Not all types of medication can be used in a subcutaneous infusion. In particular, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlorpromazine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2213\">chlorpromazine hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/prochlorperazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2247\">prochlorperazine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diazepam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2159\">diazepam</xref> are <b>contra-indicated</b> as they cause skin reactions at the injection site; to a lesser extent <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cyclizine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2522\">cyclizine</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/levomepromazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2234\">levomepromazine</xref> also sometimes cause local irritation.</p>
      <p>In theory injections dissolved in water for injections are more likely to be associated with pain (possibly owing to their hypotonicity). The use of physiological saline (<xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-chloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5143\">sodium chloride</xref> 0.9%) however increases the likelihood of precipitation when more than one drug is used; moreover subcutaneous infusion rates are so slow (0.1– 0.3 mL/hour) that pain is not usually a problem when water is used as a diluent.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Compatibility with diamorphine</p>
      <p>Diamorphine can be given by <i>subcutaneous infusion</i> in a strength of up to 250 mg/mL; up to a strength of 40 mg/mL either <i>water for injections</i> or <i>physiological saline</i> (sodium chloride 0.9%) is a suitable diluent—above that strength only <i>water for injections</i> is used (to avoid precipitation).</p>
      <p>The following can be mixed with <i>diamorphine</i>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Cyclizine</b>, may precipitate at concentrations above 10 mg/mL <i>or</i> in the presence of sodium chloride 0.9% <i>or</i> as the concentration of diamorphine relative to cyclizine increases; mixtures of diamorphine and cyclizine are also likely to precipitate after 24 hours.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Dexamethasone</b>, special care is needed to avoid precipitation of dexamethasone when preparing it.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Haloperidol</b>, mixtures of haloperidol and diamorphine are likely to precipitate after 24 hours if haloperidol concentration is above 2 mg/mL.</li>
        <li>

          <b>Levomepromazine</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Metoclopramide</b>, under some conditions infusions containing metoclopramide become discoloured; such solutions should be discarded.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Midazolam</b>
        </li>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Problems encountered with syringe drivers</p>
      <p>The following are problems that may be encountered with syringe drivers and the action that should be taken:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if the subcutaneous infusion runs <i>too quickly</i> check the rate setting and the calculation;</li>
        <li>if the subcutaneous infusion runs <i>too slowly</i> check the start button, the battery, the syringe driver, the cannula, and make sure that the injection site is not inflamed;</li>
        <li>if there is an <i>injection site reaction</i> make sure that the site does not need to be changed—firmness or swelling at the site of injection is not in itself an indication for change, but pain or obvious inflammation is.</li>

Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual. Careful assessment of symptoms and needs of the patient should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team.

Specialist palliative care is available in most areas as day hospice care, home-care teams (often known as Macmillan teams), in-patient hospice care, and hospital teams. Many acute hospitals and teaching centres now have consultative, hospital-based teams.

Hospice care of terminally ill patients has shown the importance of symptom control and psychosocial support of the patient and family. Families should be included in the care of the patient if they wish.

Many patients wish to remain at home with their families. Although some families may at first be afraid of caring for the patient at home, support can be provided by community nursing services, social services, voluntary agencies and hospices together with the general practitioner. The family may be reassured by the knowledge that the patient will be admitted to a hospital or hospice if the family cannot cope.

Drug treatment

The number of drugs should be as few as possible, for even the taking of medicine may be an effort. Oral medication is usually satisfactory unless there is severe nausea and vomiting, dysphagia, weakness, or coma, when parenteral medication may be necessary.

Pain

Pain management in palliative care is focused on achieving control of pain by administering the right drug in the right dose at the right time. Analgesics can be divided into three broad classes: non-opioid (paracetamol, NSAID), opioid (e.g. codeine phosphate ‘weak’, morphine ‘strong’) and adjuvant (e.g. antidepressants, antiepileptics). Drugs from the different classes are used alone or in combination according to the type of pain and response to treatment. Analgesics are more effective in preventing pain than in the relief of established pain; it is important that they are given regularly.

Paracetamol or a NSAID given regularly will often be sufficient to manage mild pain. If non-opioid analgesics alone are not sufficient, then an opioid analgesic alone or in combination with a non-opioid analgesic at an adequate dosage, may be helpful in the control of moderate pain. Codeine phosphate or tramadol hydrochloride can be considered for moderate pain. If these preparations do not control the pain then morphine is the most useful opioid analgesic. Alternatives to morphine, including transdermal buprenorphine, transdermal fentanyl, hydromorphone hydrochloride, methadone hydrochloride, or oxycodone hydrochloride, should be initiated by those with experience in palliative care. Initiation of an opioid analgesic should not be delayed by concern over a theoretical likelihood of psychological dependence (addiction).

Bone metastases

In addition to the above approach, radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, and radioactive isotopes of strontium ranelate (Metastron available from GE Healthcare) may be useful for pain due to bone metastases.

Neuropathic pain

Patients with neuropathic pain may benefit from a trial of a tricyclic antidepressant. An antiepileptic may be added or substituted if pain persists; gabapentin and pregabalin are licensed for neuropathic pain. Ketamine is sometimes used under specialist supervision for neuropathic pain that responds poorly to opioid analgesics. Pain due to nerve compression may be reduced by a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone, which reduces oedema around the tumour, thus reducing compression. Nerve blocks or regional anaesthesia techniques (including the use of epidural and intrathecal catheters) can be considered when pain is localised to a specific area.

Pain management with opioids

Oral route

Treatment with morphine is given by mouth as immediate-release or modified-release preparations. During the titration phase the initial dose is based on the previous medication used, the severity of the pain, and other factors such as presence of renal impairment, increasing age, or frailty. The dose is given either as an immediate-release preparation 4-hourly or as a modified- release preparation 12-hourly, in addition to rescue doses.

If pain occurs between regular doses of morphine (‘breakthrough pain’), an additional dose (‘rescue dose’) of immediate-release morphine should be given. An additional dose should also be given 30 minutes before an activity that causes pain, such as wound dressing. The standard dose of a strong opioid for breakthrough pain is usually one-tenth to one-sixth of the regular 24-hour dose, repeated every 2–4 hours as required (up to hourly may be needed if pain is severe or in the last days of life). Review pain management if rescue analgesic is required frequently (twice daily or more). Each patient should be assessed on an individual basis. Formulations of fentanyl that are administered nasally, buccally or sublingually are also licensed for breakthrough pain.

When adjusting the dose of morphine, the number of rescue doses required and the response to them should be taken into account; increments of morphine should not exceed one-third to one-half of the total daily dose every 24 hours. Thereafter, the dose should be adjusted with careful assessment of the pain, and the use of adjuvant analgesics should also be considered. Upward titration of the dose of morphine stops when either the pain is relieved or unacceptable adverse effects occur, after which it is necessary to consider alternative measures.

Morphine immediate-release 30mg 4-hourly (or modified- release 100 mg 12-hourly) is usually adequate for most patients; some patients require morphine immediate- release up to 200mg 4-hourly (or modified-release 600 mg 12-hourly), occasionally more is needed.

Once their pain is controlled, patients started on 4-hourly immediate-release morphine can be transferred to the same total 24-hour dose of morphine given as the modified-release preparation for 12-hourly or 24-hourly administration. The first dose of the modified-release preparation is given with, or within 4 hours of, the last dose of the immediate-release preparation. For preparations suitable for 12-hourly or 24-hourly administration see modified-release preparations under morphine. Increments should be made to the dose, not to the frequency of administration. The patient must be monitored closely for efficacy and side-effects, particularly constipation, and nausea and vomiting. A suitable laxative should be prescribed routinely.

Oxycodone hydrochloride can be used in patients who require an opioid but cannot tolerate morphine. If the patient is already receiving an opioid, oxycodone hydrochloride should be started at a dose equivalent to the current analgesic (see below). Oxycodone hydrochloride immediate-release preparations can be given for breakthrough pain.

Equivalent doses of opioid analgesics. This table is only an approximate guide (doses may not correspond with those given in clinical practice); patients should be carefully monitored after any change in medication and dose titration may be required.Analgesic/RouteDoseCodeine: PO100 mgDiamorphine: IM, IV, SC3 mgDihydrocodeine: PO100 mgHydromorphone: PO2 mgMorphine: PO10 mgMorphine: IM, IV, SC5 mgOxycodone: PO6.6 mgTramadol: PO100 mgPO = by mouth; IM = intramuscular; IV = intravenous; SC = subcutaneousParenteral route

The equivalent parenteral dose of morphine (subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous) is about half of the oral dose. If the patient becomes unable to swallow, generally morphine is administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion (for details, see Continuous Subcutaneous Infusions below). Diamorphine hydrochloride is sometimes preferred, because being more soluble, it can be given in a smaller volume. The equivalent subcutaneous dose of diamorphine hydrochloride is about one-third of the oral dose of morphine.

If the patient can resume taking medicines by mouth, then oral morphine may be substituted for subcutaneous infusion of morphine or diamorphine hydrochloride, see table above of approximate equivalent doses of morphine and diamorphine hydrochloride. The infusion is discontinued when the first oral dose of morphine is given.

Rectal route

Morphine is also available for rectal administration as suppositories; alternatively oxycodone hydrochloride suppositories can be obtained on special order.

Transdermal route

Transdermal preparations of fentanyl and buprenorphine are available, they are not suitable for acute pain or in patients whose analgesic requirements are changing rapidly because the long time to steady state prevents rapid titration of the dose. Prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the correct use of transdermal preparations, see under buprenorphine and fentanyl (inappropriate use has caused fatalities). Immediate-release morphine can be given for breakthrough pain.

The following 24-hour oral doses of morphine are considered to be approximately equivalent to the buprenorphine and fentanyl patches shown, however when switching due to possible opioid-induced hyperalgesia, reduce the calculated equivalent dose of the new opioid by one-quarter to one-half.

Several recommendations in this section involve unlicensed indications or routes.

Anorexia

Anorexia may be helped by prednisolone or dexamethasone.

Bowel colic and excessive respiratory secretions

Bowel colic and excessive respiratory secretions may be reduced by a subcutaneous injection of hyoscine hydrobromide, hyoscine butylbromide, or glycopyrronium bromide. These antimuscarinics are generally given every 4 hours when required, but hourly use is occasionally necessary, particularly in excessive respiratory secretions. If symptoms persist, they can be given regularly via a continuous infusion device. Care is required to avoid the discomfort of dry mouth.

Capillary bleeding

Capillary bleeding can be treated with tranexamic acid by mouth; treatment is usually discontinued one week after the bleeding has stopped, or, if necessary, it can be continued at a reduced dose. Alternatively, gauze soaked in tranexamic acid 100 mg/mL or adrenaline/epinephrine solution 1 mg/mL (1 in 1000) can be applied to the affected area.

Vitamin K may be useful for the treatment and prevention of bleeding associated with prolonged clotting in liver disease. In severe chronic cholestasis, absorption of vitamin K may be impaired; either parenteral or water-soluble oral vitamin K (see phytomenadione) should be considered.

Constipation

Constipation is a common cause of distress and is almost invariable after administration of an opioid analgesic. It should be prevented if possible by the regular administration of laxatives; a faecal softener with a peristaltic stimulant (e.g. co-danthramer) or lactulose solution with a senna preparation should be used. Methylnaltrexone bromide is licensed for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation.

Convulsions

Patients with cerebral tumours or uraemia may be susceptible to convulsions. Prophylactic treatment with phenytoin or carbamazepine should be considered. When oral medication is no longer possible, diazepam given rectally, or phenobarbital by injection is continued as prophylaxis. For the use of midazolam by subcutaneous infusion using a continuous infusion device see below.

Dry mouth

Dry mouth may be relieved by good mouth care and measures such as chewing sugar-free gum, sucking ice or pineapple chunks, or the use of artificial saliva ,dry mouth associated with candidiasis can be treated by oral preparations of nystatin or miconazole, alternatively, fluconazole can be given by mouth . Dry mouth may be caused by certain medications including opioids, antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. hyoscine), antidepressants and some antiemetics; if possible, an alternative preparation should be considered.

Dysphagia

A corticosteroid such as dexamethasone may help, temporarily, if there is an obstruction due to tumour. See also Dry mouth, above.

Dyspnoea

Breathlessness at rest may be relieved by regular oral morphine in carefully titrated doses. Diazepam may be helpful for dyspnoea associated with anxiety. A corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, may also be helpful if there is bronchospasm or partial obstruction.

Fungating tumours

Fungating tumours can be treated by regular dressing and antibacterial drugs; systemic treatment with metronidazole is often required to reduce malodour but topical metronidazole is also used.

Gastro-intestinal pain

The pain of bowel colic may be reduced by loperamide hydrochloride. Hyoscine hydrobromide may also be helpful, given sublingually as Kwells tablets. Subcutaneous injections of hyoscine butylbromide, hyoscine hydrobromide, and glycopyrronium bromide can also be used to treat bowel colic.

Gastric distension pain due to pressure on the stomach may be helped by a preparation incorporating an antacid with an antiflatulent and a prokinetic such as domperidone before meals.

Hiccup

Hiccup due to gastric distension may be helped by a preparation incorporating an antacid with an antiflatulent. If this fails, metoclopramide hydrochloride by mouth or by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection can be added; if this also fails, baclofen, or nifedipine, or chlorpromazine hydrochloride can be tried.

Insomnia

Patients with advanced cancer may not sleep because of discomfort, cramps, night sweats, joint stiffness, or fear. There should be appropriate treatment of these problems before hypnotics are used. Benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, may be useful.

Intractable cough

Intractable cough may be relieved by moist inhalations or by regular administration of oral morphine. Methadone hydrochloride linctus should be avoided because it has a long duration of action and tends to accumulate.

Muscle spasm

The pain of muscle spasm can be helped by a muscle relaxant such as diazepam or baclofen.

Nausea and vomiting

Nausea and vomiting are common in patients with advanced cancer. Ideally, the cause should be determined before treatment with an antiemetic is started. A prokinetic antiemetic may be a preferred choice for first-line therapy.

Nausea and vomiting may occur with opioid therapy particularly in the initial stages but can be prevented by giving an antiemetic such as haloperidol or metoclopramide hydrochloride. An antiemetic is usually necessary only for the first 4 or 5 days and therefore combined preparations containing an opioid with an antiemetic are not recommended because they lead to unnecessary antiemetic therapy (and associated side-effects when used long-term).

Metoclopramide hydrochloride has a prokinetic action and is used by mouth for nausea and vomiting associated with gastritis, gastric stasis, and functional bowel obstruction. Drugs with antimuscarinic effects antagonise prokinetic drugs and, if possible, should not be used concurrently.

Haloperidol is used by mouth for most metabolic causes of vomiting (e.g. hypercalcaemia, renal failure).

Cyclizine is given by mouth. It is used for nausea and vomiting due to mechanical bowel obstruction, raised intracranial pressure, and motion sickness.

Levomepromazine is used as an antiemetic; it is given by mouth or by subcutaneous injection at bedtime. For the dose by subcutaneous infusion see below. Dexamethasone by mouth can be used as an adjunct.

Antiemetic therapy should be reviewed every 24 hours; it may be necessary to substitute the antiemetic or to add another one.

For the administration of antiemetics by subcutaneous infusion using a continuous infusion device, see below.

For the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy see Cytotoxic drugs.

Pruritus

Pruritus, even when associated with obstructive jaundice, often responds to simple measures such as application of emollients. In the case of obstructive jaundice, further measures include administration of colestyramine).

Raised intracranial pressure

Headache due to raised intracranial pressure often responds to a high dose of a corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone and should be given before 6 p.m. to reduce the risk of insomnia.

Restlessness and confusion

Restlessness and confusion may require treatment with an antipsychotic, e.g. haloperidol or levomepromazine, by mouth or by subcutaneous injection, both repeated every 2 hours if required. The dose and frequency is adjusted according to the level of patient distress and the response. A regular maintenance dose should also be considered, given twice daily either by mouth or by subcutaneous injection; alternatively use a continuous infusion device.

Levomepromazine is licensed to treat pain in palliative care—this use is reserved for distressed patients with severe pain unresponsive to other measures (seek specialist advice).

Continuous subcutaneous infusions

Although drugs can usually be administered by mouth to control the symptoms of advanced cancer, the parenteral route may sometimes be necessary. Repeated administration of intramuscular injections can be difficult in a cachectic patient. This has led to the use of portable continuous infusion devices, such as syringe drivers, to give a continuous subcutaneous infusion, which can provide good control of symptoms with little discomfort or inconvenience to the patient.

Indications for the parenteral route are:

the patient is unable to take medicines by mouth owing to nausea and vomiting, dysphagia, severe weakness, or comathere is malignant bowel obstruction in patients for whom further surgery is inappropriate (avoiding the need for an intravenous infusion or for insertion of a nasogastric tube)occasionally when the patient does not wish to take regular medication by mouth.Syringe driver rate settings

Staff using syringe drivers should be adequately trained and different rate settings should be clearly identified and differentiated; incorrect use of syringe drivers is a common cause of medication errors.

Bowel colic and excessive respiratory secretions

Hyoscine hydrobromide effectively reduces respiratory secretions and bowel colic and is sedative (but occasionally causes paradoxical agitation).

Hyoscine butylbromide is used for bowel colic and for excessive respiratory secretions, and is less sedative than hyoscine hydrobromide. 

Glycopyrronium bromide may also be used to treat bowel colic or excessive respiratory secretions.

Confusion and restlessness

Haloperidol has little sedative effect.

Levomepromazine has a sedative effect. 

Midazolam is a sedative and an antiepileptic that may be used in addition to an antipsychotic drug in a very restless patient. Midazolam is also used for myoclonus.

Convulsions

If a patient has previously been receiving an antiepileptic drug or has a primary or secondary cerebral tumour or is at risk of convulsion (e.g. owing to uraemia) antiepileptic medication should not be stopped. Midazolam is the benzodiazepine antiepileptic of choice for continuous subcutaneous infusion.

Nausea and vomiting

Haloperidol and levomepromazine can both be given as a subcutaneous infusion  but sedation can limit the dose of levomepromazine.

Cyclizine is particularly likely to precipitate if mixed with diamorphine or other drugs (see under Mixing and Compatibility, below)

Metoclopramide hydrochloride can cause skin reactions.

Octreotide, which stimulates water and electrolyte absorption and inhibits water secretion in the small bowel, can be used by subcutaneous infusion to reduce intestinal secretions and to reduce vomiting due to bowel obstruction.

Pain control

Diamorphine hydrochloride is the preferred opioid since its high solubility permits a large dose to be given in a small volume (see under Mixing and Compatibility, below). The table shows approximate equivalent doses of morphine and diamorphine hydrochloride.

Mixing and compatibility

The general principle that injections should be given into separate sites (and should not be mixed) does not apply to the use of syringe drivers in palliative care. Provided that there is evidence of compatibility, selected injections can be mixed in syringe drivers. Not all types of medication can be used in a subcutaneous infusion. In particular, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, prochlorperazine, and diazepam are contra-indicated as they cause skin reactions at the injection site; to a lesser extent cyclizine and levomepromazine also sometimes cause local irritation.

In theory injections dissolved in water for injections are more likely to be associated with pain (possibly owing to their hypotonicity). The use of physiological saline (sodium chloride 0.9%) however increases the likelihood of precipitation when more than one drug is used; moreover subcutaneous infusion rates are so slow (0.1– 0.3 mL/hour) that pain is not usually a problem when water is used as a diluent.

Compatibility with diamorphine

Diamorphine can be given by subcutaneous infusion in a strength of up to 250 mg/mL; up to a strength of 40 mg/mL either water for injections or physiological saline (sodium chloride 0.9%) is a suitable diluent—above that strength only water for injections is used (to avoid precipitation).

The following can be mixed with diamorphine:

Cyclizine, may precipitate at concentrations above 10 mg/mL or in the presence of sodium chloride 0.9% or as the concentration of diamorphine relative to cyclizine increases; mixtures of diamorphine and cyclizine are also likely to precipitate after 24 hours.Dexamethasone, special care is needed to avoid precipitation of dexamethasone when preparing it.Haloperidol, mixtures of haloperidol and diamorphine are likely to precipitate after 24 hours if haloperidol concentration is above 2 mg/mL.Hyoscine butylbromideHyoscine hydrobromideLevomepromazineMetoclopramide, under some conditions infusions containing metoclopramide become discoloured; such solutions should be discarded.MidazolamSubcutaneous infusion solution should be monitored regularly both to check for precipitation (and discolouration) and to ensure that the infusion is running at the correct rate.

Problems encountered with syringe drivers

The following are problems that may be encountered with syringe drivers and the action that should be taken:

if the subcutaneous infusion runs too quickly check the rate setting and the calculation;if the subcutaneous infusion runs too slowly check the start button, the battery, the syringe driver, the cannula, and make sure that the injection site is not inflamed;if there is an injection site reaction make sure that the site does not need to be changed—firmness or swelling at the site of injection is not in itself an indication for change, but pain or obvious inflammation is.Equivalent doses of morphine sulfate and diamorphine hydrochloride given over 24 hours These equivalences are approximate only and should be adjusted according to responseMORPHINEPARENTERAL DIAMORPHINEOral morphine sulfate over 24 hoursSubcutaneous infusion of morphine sulfate over 24 hoursSubcutaneous infusion of diamorphine hydrochloride over 24 hours30 mg15 mg10 mg60 mg30 mg20 mg90 mg45 mg30 mg120 mg60 mg40 mg180 mg90 mg60 mg240 mg120 mg80 mg360 mg180 mg120 mg480 mg240 mg160 mg600 mg300 mg200 mg780 mg390 mg260 mg960 mg480 mg320 mg1200 mg600 mg400 mgIf breakthrough pain occurs give a subcutaneous (preferable) or intramuscular injection equivalent to one-tenth to one-sixth of the total 24-hour subcutaneous infusion dose. It is kinder to give an intermittent bolus injection subcutaneously—absorption is smoother so that the risk of adverse effects at peak absorption is avoided (an even better method is to use a subcutaneous butterfly needle). To minimise the risk of infection no individual subcutaneous infusion solution should be used for longer than 24 hours."""^^xsd:string];

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Problems</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Microbial contamination</p>
      <p>The accidental entry and subsequent growth of micro-organisms converts the infusion fluid pathway into a potential vehicle for infection with micro-organisms, particularly species of <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>Candida</i></ph>, <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>Enterobacter</i></ph>, and <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>Klebsiella</i></ph>. Ready-prepared infusions containing the additional drugs, or infusions prepared by an additive service (when available) should therefore be used in preference to making extemporaneous additions to infusion containers on wards etc. However, when this is necessary strict aseptic procedure should be followed.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Incompatibility</p>
      <p>Physical and chemical incompatibilities may occur with loss of potency, increase in toxicity, or other adverse effect. The solutions may become opalescent or precipitation may occur, but in many instances there is no visual indication of incompatibility. Interaction may take place at any point in the infusion fluid pathway, and the potential for incompatibility is increased when more than one substance is added to the infusion fluid.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Common incompatibilities</p>
      <p>Precipitation reactions are numerous and varied and may occur as a result of pH, concentration changes, ‘salting-out’ effects, complexation or other chemical changes. Precipitation or other particle formation must be avoided since, apart from lack of control of dosage on administration, it may initiate or exacerbate adverse effects. This is particularly important in the case of drugs which have been implicated in either thrombophlebitis (e.g. diazepam) or in skin sloughing or necrosis caused by extravasation (e.g. sodium bicarbonate and certain cytotoxic drugs). It is also especially important to effect solution of colloidal drugs and to prevent their subsequent precipitation in order to avoid a pyrogenic reaction (e.g. amphotericin).</p>
      <p>It is considered undesirable to mix beta-lactam antibiotics, such as semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins, with proteinaceous materials on the grounds that immunogenic and allergenic conjugates could be formed.</p>
      <p>A number of preparations undergo significant loss of potency when added singly or in combination to large volume infusions. Examples include ampicillin in infusions that contain glucose or lactates. The breakdown products of dacarbazine have been implicated in adverse effects.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Blood</p>
      <p>Because of the large number of incompatibilities, drugs should not normally be added to blood and blood products for infusion purposes. Examples of incompatibility with blood include hypertonic mannitol solutions (irreversible crenation of red cells), dextrans (rouleaux formation and interference with cross-matching), glucose (clumping of red cells), and oxytocin (inactivated).</p>
      <p>If the giving set is not changed after the administration of blood, but used for other infusion fluids, a fibrin clot may form which, apart from blocking the set, increases the likelihood of microbial growth.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Intravenous fat emulsions</p>
      <p>These may break down with coalescence of fat globules and separation of phases when additions such as antibacterials or electrolytes are made, thus increasing the possibility of embolism. Only specially formulated products such as <i>Vitlipid N</i><sup><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /></sup> may be added to appropriate intravenous fat emulsions.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Other infusions</p>
      <p>Infusions that frequently give rise to incompatibility include amino acids, mannitol, and sodium bicarbonate.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Bactericides</p>
      <p>Bactericides such as chlorocresol 0.1% or phenylmercuric nitrate 0.001% are present in some injection solutions. The total volume of such solutions added to a container for infusion on one occasion should not exceed 15 mL.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Method</p>
    <p>Ready-prepared infusions should be used whenever available. <b>Potassium chloride</b> is usually available in concentrations of 20, 27, and 40 mmol/litre in sodium chloride intravenous infusion (0.9%), glucose intravenous infusion (5%) or sodium chloride and glucose intravenous infusion. <b>Lidocaine hydrochloride</b> is usually available in concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2% in glucose intravenous infusion (5%).</p>
    <p>When addition is required to be made extemporaneously, any product reconstitution instructions such as those relating to concentration, vehicle, mixing, and handling precautions should be strictly followed using an aseptic technique throughout. Once the product has been reconstituted, addition to the infusion fluid should be made immediately in order to minimise microbial contamination and, with certain products, to prevent degradation or other formulation change which may occur; e.g. reconstituted ampicillin injection degrades rapidly on standing, and also may form polymers which could cause sensitivity reactions.</p>
    <p>It is also important in certain instances that an infusion fluid of specific pH be used (e.g. <b>furosemide</b> injection requires dilution in infusions of pH greater than 5.5).</p>
    <p>When drug additions are made it is important to mix thoroughly; additions should not be made to an infusion container that has been connected to a giving set, as mixing is hampered. If the solutions are not thoroughly mixed a concentrated layer of the additive may form owing to differences in density. <b>Potassium chloride</b> is particularly prone to this ‘layering’ effect when added without adequate mixing to infusions packed in non-rigid infusion containers; if such a mixture is administered it may have a serious effect on the heart.</p>
    <p>A time limit between addition and completion of administration must be imposed for certain admixtures to guarantee satisfactory drug potency and compatibility. For admixtures in which degradation occurs without the formation of toxic substances, an acceptable limit is the time taken for 10% decomposition of the drug. When toxic substances are produced stricter limits may be imposed. Because of the risk of microbial contamination a maximum time limit of 24 hours may be appropriate for additions made elsewhere than in hospital pharmacies offering central additive service.</p>
    <p>Certain injections must be protected from light during continuous infusion to minimise oxidation, e.g. dacarbazine and sodium nitroprusside.</p>
    <p>Dilution with a small volume of an appropriate vehicle and administration using a motorised infusion pump is advocated for preparations such as unfractionated heparin where strict control over administration is required. In this case the appropriate dose may be dissolved in a convenient volume (e.g. 24–48 mL) of sodium chloride intravenous infusion (0.9%).</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Information provided in the BNF</p>
    <p>The <i>BNF</i> gives information about preparations given by three methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>continuous infusion;</li>
      <li>intermittent infusion;</li>
      <li>addition via the drip tubing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Drugs for <b>continuous infusion</b> must be diluted in a large volume infusion. Penicillins and cephalosporins are not usually given by continuous infusion because of stability problems and because adequate plasma and tissue concentrations are best obtained by intermittent infusion. Where it is necessary to administer them by continuous infusion, detailed literature should be consulted.</p>
    <p>Drugs that are both compatible and clinically suitable may be given by <b>intermittent infusion</b> in a relatively small volume of infusion over a short period of time, e.g. 100 mL in 30 minutes. The method is used if the product is incompatible or unstable over the period necessary for continuous infusion; the limited stability of ampicillin or amoxicillin in large volume glucose or lactate infusions may be overcome in this way.</p>
    <p>Intermittent infusion is also used if adequate plasma and tissue concentrations are not produced by continuous infusion as in the case of drugs such as dacarbazine, gentamicin, and ticarcillin.</p>
    <p>An in-line burette may be used for intermittent infusion techniques in order to achieve strict control over the time and rate of administration, especially for infants and children and in intensive care units. Intermittent infusion may also make use of the ‘piggy-back’ technique provided that no additions are made to the primary infusion. In this method the drug is added to a small secondary container connected to a Y-type injection site on the primary infusion giving set; the secondary solution is usually infused within 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Addition <i>via</i> the drip tubing</b> is indicated for a number of cytotoxic drugs in order to minimise extravasation. The preparation is added aseptically via the rubber septum of the injection site of a fast-running infusion. In general, drug preparations intended for a bolus effect should be given directly into a separate vein where possible. Failing this, administration may be made via the drip tubing provided that the preparation is compatible with the infusion fluid when given in this manner.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Drugs given by intravenous infusion</p>
      <p>The BNF includes information on addition to <i>Glucose intravenous infusion </i> 5 and 10%, and <i>Sodium chloride intravenous infusion</i> 0.9%. Compatibility with glucose 5% and with sodium chloride 0.9% indicates compatibility with <i>Sodium chloride and glucose intravenous infusion</i>. Infusion of a large volume of hypotonic solution should be avoided therefore care should be taken if water for injections is used. The information relates to the proprietary preparations indicated; for other preparations suitability should be checked with the manufacturer.</p>

A local policy on the addition of drugs to intravenous fluids should be drawn up by a multi-disciplinary team in each Strategic Health Authority (or equivalent) and issued as a document to the members of staff concerned.

Centralised additive services are provided in a number of hospital pharmacy departments and should be used in preference to making additions on wards.

The information that follows should be read in conjunction with local policy documents.

Because of the large number of incompatibilities, drugs should not normally be added to blood and blood products for infusion purposes. Examples of incompatibility with blood include hypertonic mannitol solutions (irreversible crenation of red cells), dextrans (rouleaux formation and interference with cross-matching), glucose (clumping of red cells), and oxytocin (inactivated).

If the giving set is not changed after the administration of blood, but used for other infusion fluids, a fibrin clot may form which, apart from blocking the set, increases the likelihood of microbial growth.

Intravenous fat emulsions

These may break down with coalescence of fat globules and separation of phases when additions such as antibacterials or electrolytes are made, thus increasing the possibility of embolism. Only specially formulated products such as Vitlipid N may be added to appropriate intravenous fat emulsions.

Other infusions

Infusions that frequently give rise to incompatibility include amino acids, mannitol, and sodium bicarbonate.

Bactericides

Bactericides such as chlorocresol 0.1% or phenylmercuric nitrate 0.001% are present in some injection solutions. The total volume of such solutions added to a container for infusion on one occasion should not exceed 15 mL.

Method

Ready-prepared infusions should be used whenever available. Potassium chloride is usually available in concentrations of 20, 27, and 40 mmol/litre in sodium chloride intravenous infusion (0.9%), glucose intravenous infusion (5%) or sodium chloride and glucose intravenous infusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is usually available in concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2% in glucose intravenous infusion (5%).

When addition is required to be made extemporaneously, any product reconstitution instructions such as those relating to concentration, vehicle, mixing, and handling precautions should be strictly followed using an aseptic technique throughout. Once the product has been reconstituted, addition to the infusion fluid should be made immediately in order to minimise microbial contamination and, with certain products, to prevent degradation or other formulation change which may occur; e.g. reconstituted ampicillin injection degrades rapidly on standing, and also may form polymers which could cause sensitivity reactions.

It is also important in certain instances that an infusion fluid of specific pH be used (e.g. furosemide injection requires dilution in infusions of pH greater than 5.5).

When drug additions are made it is important to mix thoroughly; additions should not be made to an infusion container that has been connected to a giving set, as mixing is hampered. If the solutions are not thoroughly mixed a concentrated layer of the additive may form owing to differences in density. Potassium chloride is particularly prone to this ‘layering’ effect when added without adequate mixing to infusions packed in non-rigid infusion containers; if such a mixture is administered it may have a serious effect on the heart.

A time limit between addition and completion of administration must be imposed for certain admixtures to guarantee satisfactory drug potency and compatibility. For admixtures in which degradation occurs without the formation of toxic substances, an acceptable limit is the time taken for 10% decomposition of the drug. When toxic substances are produced stricter limits may be imposed. Because of the risk of microbial contamination a maximum time limit of 24 hours may be appropriate for additions made elsewhere than in hospital pharmacies offering central additive service.

Certain injections must be protected from light during continuous infusion to minimise oxidation, e.g. dacarbazine and sodium nitroprusside.

Dilution with a small volume of an appropriate vehicle and administration using a motorised infusion pump is advocated for preparations such as unfractionated heparin where strict control over administration is required. In this case the appropriate dose may be dissolved in a convenient volume (e.g. 24–48 mL) of sodium chloride intravenous infusion (0.9%).

Information provided in the BNF

The BNF gives information about preparations given by three methods:

continuous infusion;intermittent infusion;addition via the drip tubing.Drugs for continuous infusion must be diluted in a large volume infusion. Penicillins and cephalosporins are not usually given by continuous infusion because of stability problems and because adequate plasma and tissue concentrations are best obtained by intermittent infusion. Where it is necessary to administer them by continuous infusion, detailed literature should be consulted.

Drugs that are both compatible and clinically suitable may be given by intermittent infusion in a relatively small volume of infusion over a short period of time, e.g. 100 mL in 30 minutes. The method is used if the product is incompatible or unstable over the period necessary for continuous infusion; the limited stability of ampicillin or amoxicillin in large volume glucose or lactate infusions may be overcome in this way.

Intermittent infusion is also used if adequate plasma and tissue concentrations are not produced by continuous infusion as in the case of drugs such as dacarbazine, gentamicin, and ticarcillin.

An in-line burette may be used for intermittent infusion techniques in order to achieve strict control over the time and rate of administration, especially for infants and children and in intensive care units. Intermittent infusion may also make use of the ‘piggy-back’ technique provided that no additions are made to the primary infusion. In this method the drug is added to a small secondary container connected to a Y-type injection site on the primary infusion giving set; the secondary solution is usually infused within 30 minutes.

Addition via the drip tubing is indicated for a number of cytotoxic drugs in order to minimise extravasation. The preparation is added aseptically via the rubber septum of the injection site of a fast-running infusion. In general, drug preparations intended for a bolus effect should be given directly into a separate vein where possible. Failing this, administration may be made via the drip tubing provided that the preparation is compatible with the infusion fluid when given in this manner.

Drugs given by intravenous infusion

The BNF includes information on addition to Glucose intravenous infusion  5 and 10%, and Sodium chloride intravenous infusion 0.9%. Compatibility with glucose 5% and with sodium chloride 0.9% indicates compatibility with Sodium chloride and glucose intravenous infusion. Infusion of a large volume of hypotonic solution should be avoided therefore care should be taken if water for injections is used. The information relates to the proprietary preparations indicated; for other preparations suitability should be checked with the manufacturer.

Liver disease may alter the response to drugs in several ways as indicated below, and drug prescribing should be kept to a minimum in all patients with severe liver disease. The main problems occur in patients with jaundice, ascites, or evidence of encephalopathy.

Impaired drug metabolism

Metabolism by the liver is the main route of elimination for many drugs, but hepatic reserve is large and liver disease has to be severe before important changes in drug metabolism occur. Routine liver-function tests are a poor guide to the capacity of the liver to metabolise drugs, and in the individual patient it is not possible to predict the extent to which the metabolism of a particular drug may be impaired.

A few drugs, e.g. rifampicin and fusidic acid, are excreted in the bile unchanged and can accumulate in patients with intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstructive jaundice.

Hypoproteinaemia

The hypoalbuminaemia in severe liver disease is associated with reduced protein binding and increased toxicity of some highly protein-bound drugs such as phenytoin and prednisolone.

Reduced clotting

Reduced hepatic synthesis of blood-clotting factors, indicated by a prolonged prothrombin time, increases the sensitivity to oral anticoagulants such as warfarin sodium and phenindione.

Hepatic encephalopathy

In severe liver disease many drugs can further impair cerebral function and may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. These include all sedative drugs, opioid analgesics, those diuretics that produce hypokalaemia, and drugs that cause constipation.

Fluid overload

Oedema and ascites in chronic liver disease can be exacerbated by drugs that give rise to fluid retention e.g. NSAIDs and corticosteroids.

Hepatotoxic drugs

Hepatotoxicity is either dose-related or unpredictable (idiosyncratic). Drugs that cause dose-related toxicity may do so at lower doses in the presence of hepatic impairment than in individuals with normal liver function, and some drugs that produce reactions of the idiosyncratic kind do so more frequently in patients with liver disease. These drugs should be avoided or used very carefully in patients with liver disease.

Where care is needed when prescribing in hepatic impairment, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">General guidance</p>
    <p>Medicines should be prescribed only when they are necessary, and in all cases the benefit of administering the medicine should be considered in relation to the risk involved. This is particularly important during pregnancy, when the risk to both mother and fetus must be considered.</p>
    <p>It is important to discuss treatment options carefully with the patient to ensure that the patient is content to take the medicine as prescribed. In particular, the patient should be helped to distinguish the adverse effects of prescribed drugs from the effects of the medical disorder. When the beneficial effects of the medicine are likely to be delayed, the patient should be advised of this.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Taking medicines to best effect</p>
    <p>Difficulties in adherence to drug treatment occur regardless of age. Factors contributing to poor compliance with prescribed medicines include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>prescription not collected or not dispensed;</li>
      <li>purpose of medicine not clear;</li>
      <li>perceived lack of efficacy;</li>
      <li>real or perceived adverse effects;</li>
      <li>patients’ perception of the risk and severity of side-effects may differ from that of the prescriber;</li>
      <li>instructions for administration not clear;</li>
      <li>physical difficulty in taking medicines (e.g. swallowing the medicine, handling small tablets, or opening medicine containers);</li>
      <li>unattractive formulation (e.g. unpleasant taste);</li>
      <li>complicated regimen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The prescriber and the patient should agree on the health outcomes that the patient desires and on the strategy for achieving them (‘concordance’). The prescriber should be sensitive to religious, cultural, and personal beliefs that can affect a patient’s acceptance of medicines.</p>
    <p>Taking the time to explain to the patient (and relatives) the rationale and the potential adverse effects of treatment may improve adherence. Reinforcement and elaboration of the physician’s instructions by the pharmacist and other members of the healthcare team also helps. Advising the patient of the possibility of alternative treatments may encourage the patient to seek advice rather than merely abandon unacceptable treatment.</p>
    <p>Simplifying the drug regimen may help; the need for frequent administration may reduce adherence, although there appears to be little difference in adherence between once-daily and twice-daily administration. Combination products reduce the number of drugs taken but at the expense of the ability to titrate individual doses.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Biosimilar medicines</p>
    <p>A biosimilar medicine is a new biological product that is similar to a medicine that has already been authorised to be marketed (the biological reference medicine) in the European Union. The active substance of a biosimilar medicine is similar, but not identical, to the biological reference medicine. Biological products are different from standard chemical products in terms of their complexity and although theoretically there should be no important differences between the biosimilar and the biological reference medicine in terms of safety or efficacy, when prescribing biological products, it is good practice to use the brand name. This will ensure that substitution of a biosimilar medicine does not occur when the medicine is dispensed.</p>
    <p>Biosimilar medicines have black triangle status at the time of initial marketing. It is important to report suspected adverse reactions to biosimilar medicines using the Yellow Card Scheme. For biosimilar medicines, adverse reaction reports should clearly state the brand name and the batch number of the suspected medicine.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Complementary and alternative medicine</p>
    <p>An increasing amount of information on complementary and alternative medicine is becoming available. The scope of the BNF is restricted to the discussion of conventional medicines but reference is made to complementary treatments if they affect conventional therapy (e.g. interactions with St John’s wort). Further information on herbal medicines is available at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk\">www.mhra.gov.uk</xref>.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Abbreviation of titles</p>
    <p>In general, titles of drugs and preparations should be written in full. Unofficial abbreviations should not be used as they may be misinterpreted.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Non-proprietary titles</p>
    <p>Where non-proprietary (‘generic’) titles are given, they should be used in prescribing. This will enable any suitable product to be dispensed, thereby saving delay to the patient and sometimes expense to the health service. The only exception is where there is a demonstrable difference in clinical effect between each manufacturer’s version of the formulation, making it important that the patient should always receive the same brand; in such cases, the brand name or the manufacturer should be stated. Non-proprietary titles should not be invented for the purposes of prescribing generically since this can lead to confusion, particularly in the case of compound and modified-release preparations.</p>
    <p>Titles used as headings for monographs may be used freely in the United Kingdom but in other countries may be subject to restriction.</p>
    <p>Many of the non-proprietary titles used in this book are titles of monographs in the European Pharmacopoeia, British Pharmacopoeia, or British Pharmaceutical Codex 1973. In such cases the preparations must comply with the standard (if any) in the appropriate publication, as required by the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Proprietary titles</p>
    <p>Names followed by the symbol<sup><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /></sup> are or have been used as proprietary names in the United Kingdom. These names may in general be applied only to products supplied by the owners of the trade marks.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Marketing authorisation and BNF advice</p>
    <p>In general the <i>doses, indications, cautions, contra-indications,</i> and <i>side-effects</i> in the BNF reflect those in the manufacturers’ data sheets or Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) which, in turn, reflect those in the corresponding marketing authorisations (formerly known as Product Licences). The BNF does not generally include proprietary medicines that are not supported by a valid Summary of Product Characteristics or when the marketing authorisation holder has not been able to supply essential information. When a preparation is available from more than one manufacturer, the BNF reflects advice that is the most clinically relevant regardless of any variation in the marketing authorisations. Unlicensed products can be obtained from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies.</p>
    <p>Where an unlicensed drug is included in the BNF, this is indicated in square brackets after the entry. When the BNF suggests a use (or route) that is outside the licensed indication of a product (‘off-label’ use), this too is indicated. Unlicensed use of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines; such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience.</p>
    <p>The doses stated in the BNF are intended for general guidance and represent, unless otherwise stated, the usual range of doses that are generally regarded as being suitable for adults.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Prescribing unlicensed medicines</p>
    <p>Prescribing medicines outside the recommendations of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescriber’s professional responsibility and potential liability. The prescriber should be able to justify and feel competent in using such medicines, and also inform the patient or the patient’s carer that the prescribed medicine is unlicensed.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Oral syringes</p>
    <p>An <b>oral syringe</b> is supplied when oral liquid medicines are prescribed in doses other than multiples of 5 mL. The oral syringe is marked in 0.5 mL divisions from 1 to 5 mL to measure doses of less than 5 mL (other sizes of oral syringe may also be available). It is provided with an adaptor and an instruction leaflet. The <i>5–mL spoon</i> is used for doses of 5 mL (or multiples thereof).</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Important</p>
      <p>To avoid inadvertent intravenous administration of oral liquid medicines, only an appropriate oral or enteral syringe should be used to measure an oral liquid medicine (if a medicine spoon or graduated measure cannot be used); these syringes should not be compatible with intravenous or other parenteral devices.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Excipients</p>
    <p>Branded oral liquid preparations that do not contain <i>fructose, glucose,</i> or <i>sucrose</i> are described as ‘sugar-free’ in the BNF. Preparations containing hydrogenated glucose syrup, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, or xylitol are also marked ‘sugar-free’ since there is evidence that they do not cause dental caries. Patients receiving medicines containing cariogenic sugars should be advised of appropriate dental hygiene measures to prevent caries. Sugar-free preparations should be used whenever possible.</p>
    <p>Where information on the presence of <i>aspartame, gluten, sulfites, tartrazine, arachis (peanut) oil</i> or <i>sesame oil</i> is available, this is indicated in the BNF against the relevant preparation.</p>
    <p>Information is provided on selected excipients in skin preparations, in vaccines, and on <i>selected preservatives</i> and <i>excipients</i> in eye drops and injections.</p>
    <p>The presence of <i>benzyl alcohol</i> and <i>polyoxyl castor oil</i> (polyethoxylated castor oil) in injections is indicated in the BNF. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal toxic syndrome in preterm neonates, and therefore, parenteral preparations containing the preservative should not be used in neonates. Polyoxyl castor oils, used as vehicles in intravenous injections, have been associated with severe anaphylactoid reactions.</p>
    <p>The presence of <i>propylene glycol</i> in oral or parenteral medicines is indicated in the BNF; it can cause adverse effects if its elimination is impaired, e.g. in renal failure, in neonates and young children, and in slow metabolisers of the substance. It may interact with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/disulfiram.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3185\">disulfiram</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metronidazole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3647\">metronidazole</xref>.</p>
    <p>The <i>lactose</i> content in most medicines is too small to cause problems in most lactose-intolerant patients. However in severe lactose intolerance, the lactose content should be determined before prescribing. The amount of lactose varies according to manufacturer, product, formulation, and strength.</p>

    <p>Prescribers and other healthcare professionals should advise patients if treatment is likely to affect their ability to perform skilled tasks (e.g. driving).

    <p>A new offence of driving, attempting to drive, or being in charge of a vehicle, with certain specified controlled drugs in excess of specified limits, came into force on 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2015. This offence is an addition to the existing rules on drug impaired driving and fitness to drive, and applies to two groups of drugs—commonly abused drugs, including amfetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ketamine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8518\">ketamine</xref>, and drugs used mainly for medical reasons, such as opioids and benzodiazepines. Anyone found to have any of the drugs (including related drugs, for example, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/apomorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3063\">apomorphine hydrochloride</xref>) above specified limits in their blood will be guilty of an offence, whether their driving was impaired or not. This also includes prescribed drugs which metabolise to those included in the offence, for example, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/selegiline-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3116\">selegiline hydrochloride</xref>. However, the legislation provides a statutory “medical defence” for patients taking drugs for medical reasons in accordance with instructions, <i>if their driving was not impaired</i>—it continues to be an offence to drive if actually impaired. Patients should therefore be advised to continue taking their medicines as prescribed, and when driving, to carry suitable evidence that the drug was prescribed, or sold, to treat a medical or dental problem, and that it was taken according to the instructions given by the prescriber, or information provided with the medicine (e.g. a repeat prescription form or the medicine’s patient information leaflet).

Medicines should be prescribed only when they are necessary, and in all cases the benefit of administering the medicine should be considered in relation to the risk involved. This is particularly important during pregnancy, when the risk to both mother and fetus must be considered.

It is important to discuss treatment options carefully with the patient to ensure that the patient is content to take the medicine as prescribed. In particular, the patient should be helped to distinguish the adverse effects of prescribed drugs from the effects of the medical disorder. When the beneficial effects of the medicine are likely to be delayed, the patient should be advised of this.

Taking medicines to best effect

Difficulties in adherence to drug treatment occur regardless of age. Factors contributing to poor compliance with prescribed medicines include:

prescription not collected or not dispensed;purpose of medicine not clear;perceived lack of efficacy;real or perceived adverse effects;patients’ perception of the risk and severity of side-effects may differ from that of the prescriber;instructions for administration not clear;physical difficulty in taking medicines (e.g. swallowing the medicine, handling small tablets, or opening medicine containers);unattractive formulation (e.g. unpleasant taste);complicated regimen.The prescriber and the patient should agree on the health outcomes that the patient desires and on the strategy for achieving them (‘concordance’). The prescriber should be sensitive to religious, cultural, and personal beliefs that can affect a patient’s acceptance of medicines.

Taking the time to explain to the patient (and relatives) the rationale and the potential adverse effects of treatment may improve adherence. Reinforcement and elaboration of the physician’s instructions by the pharmacist and other members of the healthcare team also helps. Advising the patient of the possibility of alternative treatments may encourage the patient to seek advice rather than merely abandon unacceptable treatment.

Simplifying the drug regimen may help; the need for frequent administration may reduce adherence, although there appears to be little difference in adherence between once-daily and twice-daily administration. Combination products reduce the number of drugs taken but at the expense of the ability to titrate individual doses.

Biosimilar medicines

A biosimilar medicine is a new biological product that is similar to a medicine that has already been authorised to be marketed (the biological reference medicine) in the European Union. The active substance of a biosimilar medicine is similar, but not identical, to the biological reference medicine. Biological products are different from standard chemical products in terms of their complexity and although theoretically there should be no important differences between the biosimilar and the biological reference medicine in terms of safety or efficacy, when prescribing biological products, it is good practice to use the brand name. This will ensure that substitution of a biosimilar medicine does not occur when the medicine is dispensed.

Biosimilar medicines have black triangle status at the time of initial marketing. It is important to report suspected adverse reactions to biosimilar medicines using the Yellow Card Scheme. For biosimilar medicines, adverse reaction reports should clearly state the brand name and the batch number of the suspected medicine.

Complementary and alternative medicine

An increasing amount of information on complementary and alternative medicine is becoming available. The scope of the BNF is restricted to the discussion of conventional medicines but reference is made to complementary treatments if they affect conventional therapy (e.g. interactions with St John’s wort). Further information on herbal medicines is available at www.mhra.gov.uk.

Abbreviation of titles

In general, titles of drugs and preparations should be written in full. Unofficial abbreviations should not be used as they may be misinterpreted.

Non-proprietary titles

Where non-proprietary (‘generic’) titles are given, they should be used in prescribing. This will enable any suitable product to be dispensed, thereby saving delay to the patient and sometimes expense to the health service. The only exception is where there is a demonstrable difference in clinical effect between each manufacturer’s version of the formulation, making it important that the patient should always receive the same brand; in such cases, the brand name or the manufacturer should be stated. Non-proprietary titles should not be invented for the purposes of prescribing generically since this can lead to confusion, particularly in the case of compound and modified-release preparations.

Titles used as headings for monographs may be used freely in the United Kingdom but in other countries may be subject to restriction.

Many of the non-proprietary titles used in this book are titles of monographs in the European Pharmacopoeia, British Pharmacopoeia, or British Pharmaceutical Codex 1973. In such cases the preparations must comply with the standard (if any) in the appropriate publication, as required by the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.

Proprietary titles

Names followed by the symbol are or have been used as proprietary names in the United Kingdom. These names may in general be applied only to products supplied by the owners of the trade marks.

Marketing authorisation and BNF advice

In general the doses, indications, cautions, contra-indications, and side-effects in the BNF reflect those in the manufacturers’ data sheets or Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) which, in turn, reflect those in the corresponding marketing authorisations (formerly known as Product Licences). The BNF does not generally include proprietary medicines that are not supported by a valid Summary of Product Characteristics or when the marketing authorisation holder has not been able to supply essential information. When a preparation is available from more than one manufacturer, the BNF reflects advice that is the most clinically relevant regardless of any variation in the marketing authorisations. Unlicensed products can be obtained from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies.

Where an unlicensed drug is included in the BNF, this is indicated in square brackets after the entry. When the BNF suggests a use (or route) that is outside the licensed indication of a product (‘off-label’ use), this too is indicated. Unlicensed use of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines; such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience.

The doses stated in the BNF are intended for general guidance and represent, unless otherwise stated, the usual range of doses that are generally regarded as being suitable for adults.

Prescribing unlicensed medicines

Prescribing medicines outside the recommendations of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescriber’s professional responsibility and potential liability. The prescriber should be able to justify and feel competent in using such medicines, and also inform the patient or the patient’s carer that the prescribed medicine is unlicensed.

Oral syringes

An oral syringe is supplied when oral liquid medicines are prescribed in doses other than multiples of 5 mL. The oral syringe is marked in 0.5 mL divisions from 1 to 5 mL to measure doses of less than 5 mL (other sizes of oral syringe may also be available). It is provided with an adaptor and an instruction leaflet. The 5–mL spoon is used for doses of 5 mL (or multiples thereof).

Important

To avoid inadvertent intravenous administration of oral liquid medicines, only an appropriate oral or enteral syringe should be used to measure an oral liquid medicine (if a medicine spoon or graduated measure cannot be used); these syringes should not be compatible with intravenous or other parenteral devices. Oral or enteral syringes should be clearly labelled ‘Oral’ or ‘Enteral’ in a large font size; it is the healthcare practitioner’s responsibility to label the syringe with this information if the manufacturer has not done so.

Excipients

Branded oral liquid preparations that do not contain fructose, glucose, or sucrose are described as ‘sugar-free’ in the BNF. Preparations containing hydrogenated glucose syrup, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, or xylitol are also marked ‘sugar-free’ since there is evidence that they do not cause dental caries. Patients receiving medicines containing cariogenic sugars should be advised of appropriate dental hygiene measures to prevent caries. Sugar-free preparations should be used whenever possible.

Where information on the presence of aspartame, gluten, sulfites, tartrazine, arachis (peanut) oil or sesame oil is available, this is indicated in the BNF against the relevant preparation.

Information is provided on selected excipients in skin preparations, in vaccines, and on selected preservatives and excipients in eye drops and injections.

The presence of benzyl alcohol and polyoxyl castor oil (polyethoxylated castor oil) in injections is indicated in the BNF. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal toxic syndrome in preterm neonates, and therefore, parenteral preparations containing the preservative should not be used in neonates. Polyoxyl castor oils, used as vehicles in intravenous injections, have been associated with severe anaphylactoid reactions.

The presence of propylene glycol in oral or parenteral medicines is indicated in the BNF; it can cause adverse effects if its elimination is impaired, e.g. in renal failure, in neonates and young children, and in slow metabolisers of the substance. It may interact with disulfiram and metronidazole.

The lactose content in most medicines is too small to cause problems in most lactose-intolerant patients. However in severe lactose intolerance, the lactose content should be determined before prescribing. The amount of lactose varies according to manufacturer, product, formulation, and strength.

Important

In the absence of information on excipients in the BNF and in the product literature (available at www.medicines.org.uk/emc), contact the manufacturer (see Index of Proprietary Manufacturers) if it is essential to check details. 

Extemporaneous preparation

A product should be dispensed extemporaneously only when no product with a marketing authorisation is available.

The BP direction that a preparation must be freshly prepared indicates that it must be made not more than 24 hours before it is issued for use. The direction that a preparation should be recently prepared indicates that deterioration is likely if the preparation is stored for longer than about 4 weeks at 15–25￮ C.

The term water used without qualification means either potable water freshly drawn direct from the public supply and suitable for drinking or freshly boiled and cooled purified water. The latter should be used if the public supply is from a local storage tank or if the potable water is unsuitable for a particular preparation (Water for injections).

Drugs and driving

Prescribers and other healthcare professionals should advise patients if treatment is likely to affect their ability to perform skilled tasks (e.g. driving). This applies especially to drugs with sedative effects; patients should be warned that these effects are increased by alcohol. General information about a patient’s fitness to drive is available from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at www.dvla.gov.uk.

A new offence of driving, attempting to drive, or being in charge of a vehicle, with certain specified controlled drugs in excess of specified limits, came into force on 2nd March 2015. This offence is an addition to the existing rules on drug impaired driving and fitness to drive, and applies to two groups of drugs—commonly abused drugs, including amfetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and ketamine, and drugs used mainly for medical reasons, such as opioids and benzodiazepines. Anyone found to have any of the drugs (including related drugs, for example, apomorphine hydrochloride) above specified limits in their blood will be guilty of an offence, whether their driving was impaired or not. This also includes prescribed drugs which metabolise to those included in the offence, for example, selegiline hydrochloride. However, the legislation provides a statutory “medical defence” for patients taking drugs for medical reasons in accordance with instructions, if their driving was not impaired—it continues to be an offence to drive if actually impaired. Patients should therefore be advised to continue taking their medicines as prescribed, and when driving, to carry suitable evidence that the drug was prescribed, or sold, to treat a medical or dental problem, and that it was taken according to the instructions given by the prescriber, or information provided with the medicine (e.g. a repeat prescription form or the medicine’s patient information leaflet). Further information is available from the Department for Transport at www.gov.uk/government/collections/drug-driving.

In the BNF, certain drugs have been included notwithstanding the existence of actual or potential patent rights. In so far as such substances are protected by Letters Patent, their inclusion in this Formulary neither conveys, nor implies, licence to manufacture.

Health and safety

When handling chemical or biological materials particular attention should be given to the possibility of allergy, fire, explosion, radiation, or poisoning. Substances such as corticosteroids, some antimicrobials, phenothiazines, and many cytotoxics, are irritant or very potent and should be handled with caution. Contact with the skin and inhalation of dust should be avoided.

Safety in the home

Patients must be warned to keep all medicines out of the reach of children. All solid dose and all oral and external liquid preparations must be dispensed in a reclosable child-resistant container unless:

the medicine is in an original pack or patient pack such as to make this inadvisable;the patient will have difficulty in opening a child-resistant container;a specific request is made that the product shall not be dispensed in a child-resistant container;no suitable child-resistant container exists for a particular liquid preparation.All patients should be advised to dispose of unwanted medicines by returning them to a supplier for destruction.

Labelling of prescribed medicines

There is a legal requirement for the following to appear on the label of any prescribed medicine:

name of the patient;name and address of the person dispensing the medicine;date of dispensing;name of the medicine;directions for use of the medicine;precautions relating to the use of the medicine.The Royal Pharmaceutical Society recommends that the following also appears on the label:

the words ’Keep out of the sight and reach of children’;where applicable, the words ’Use this medicine only on your skin’.A pharmacist can exercise professional skill and judgement to amend or include more appropriate wording for the name of the medicine, the directions for use, or the precautions relating to the use of the medicine.

Non-proprietary names of compound preparations

Non-proprietary names of compound preparations which appear in the BNF are those that have been compiled by the British Pharmacopoeia Commission or another recognised body; whenever possible they reflect the names of the active ingredients. 

Prescribers should avoid creating their own compound names for the purposes of generic prescribing; such names do not have an approved definition and can be misinterpreted.

Special care should be taken to avoid errors when prescribing compound preparations; in particular the hyphen in the prefix ‘co-’ should be retained.

Special care should also be taken to avoid creating generic names for modified-release preparations where the use of these names could lead to confusion between formulations with different lengths of action.

EEA and Swiss prescriptions

Pharmacists can dispense prescriptions issued by doctors and dentists from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland (except prescriptions for controlled drugs in Schedules 1, 2, or 3, or for drugs without a UK marketing authorisation).

The Councils of the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society have issued a joint statement on the security and validity of prescriptions.

In particular, prescription forms should:

    <p>In its guidelines on responsibility for prescribing (circular EL (91) 127) between hospitals and general practitioners, the Department of Health has advised that legal responsibility for prescribing lies with the doctor who signs the prescription.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Requirements</p>
    <p>Prescriptions should be written legibly in ink or otherwise so as to be indelible (it is permissible to issue carbon copies of NHS prescriptions as long as they are signed in ink), should be dated, should state the name and address of the patient, the address of the prescriber, an indication of the type of prescriber, and should be signed in ink by the prescriber (computer-generated facsimile signatures do not meet the legal requirement). The age and the date of birth of the patient should preferably be stated, and it is a legal requirement in the case of prescription-only medicines to state the age for children under 12 years. These recommendations are acceptable for <b>prescription-only medicines</b>. Prescriptions for controlled drugs have additional legal requirements.</p>
    <p>Wherever appropriate the prescriber should state the current weight of the child to enable the dose prescribed to be checked. Consideration should also be given to including the dose per unit mass e.g. mg/kg or the dose per m<sup>2</sup> body-surface area e.g. mg /m<sup>2</sup> where this would reduce error.</p>
    <p>The following should be noted:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The strength or quantity to be contained in capsules, lozenges, tablets etc. should be stated by the prescriber. In particular, strength of liquid preparations should be clearly stated (e.g. 125 mg/5 mL).</li>
      <li>The unnecessary use of decimal points should be avoided, e.g. 3 mg, not 3.0 mg. Quantities of 1 gram or more should be written as 1 g etc. Quantities less than 1 gram should be written in milligrams, e.g. 500 mg, not 0.5 g. Quantities less than 1 mg should be written in micrograms, e.g. 100 micrograms, not 0.1 mg. When decimals are unavoidable a zero should be written in front of the decimal point where there is no other figure, e.g. 0.5 mL, not .5 mL. Use of the decimal point is acceptable to express a range, e.g. 0.5 to 1 g.</li>
      <li>‘Micrograms’ and ‘nanograms’ should <b>not</b> be abbreviated. Similarly ‘units’ should <b>not</b> be abbreviated.</li>
      <li>The term ‘millilitre’ (ml or mL) is used in medicine and pharmacy, and cubic centimetre, c.c., or cm<sup>3</sup> should not be used. (The use of capital ‘L’ in mL is a printing convention throughout the BNF; both ‘mL’ and ‘ml’ are recognised SI abbreviations).</li>
      <li>Dose and dose frequency should be stated; in the case of preparations to be taken ‘as required’ a <b>minimum dose interval</b> should be specified. Care should be taken to ensure children receive the correct dose of the active drug. Therefore, the dose should normally be stated in terms of the mass of the active drug (e.g. ‘125 mg 3 times daily’); terms such as ‘5 mL’ or ‘1 tablet’ should be avoided except for compound preparations. When doses other than multiples of 5 mL are prescribed for <i>oral liquid preparations</i> the dose-volume will be provided by means of an <b>oral syringe</b>, (except for preparations intended to be measured with a pipette). Suitable quantities:<ul><li>Elixirs, Linctuses, and Paediatric Mixtures (5-mL dose), 50, 100, or 150 mL</li><li>Adult Mixtures (10 mL dose), 200 or 300 mL </li><li>Ear Drops, Eye drops, and Nasal Drops, 10 mL (or the manufacturer’s pack)</li><li>Eye Lotions, Gargles, and Mouthwashes, 200 mL</li></ul></li>
      <li>The names of drugs and preparations should be written clearly and <b>not</b> abbreviated, using approved titles <b>only</b>; <b>avoid</b> creating generic titles for modified-release preparations).</li>
      <li>The quantity to be supplied may be stated by indicating the number of days of treatment required in the box provided on NHS forms. In most cases the exact amount will be supplied. This does not apply to items directed to be used as required—if the dose and frequency are not given then the quantity to be supplied needs to be stated. When several items are ordered on one form the box can be marked with the number of days of treatment provided the quantity is added for any item for which the amount cannot be calculated.</li>
      <li>Although directions should preferably be in <b>English without abbreviation</b>, it is recognised that some Latin abbreviations are used.</li>

    <p>For computer-issued prescriptions the following advice, based on the recommendations of the Joint GP Information Technology Committee, should also be noted:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The computer must print out the date, the patient’s surname, one forename, other initials, and address, and may also print out the patient’s title and date of birth. The age of children under 12 years and of adults over 60 years must be printed in the box available; the age of children under 5 years should be printed in years and months. A facility may also exist to print out the age of patients between 12 and 60 years.</li>
      <li>The doctor’s name must be printed at the bottom of the prescription form; this will be the name of the doctor responsible for the prescription (who will normally sign it). The doctor’s surgery address, reference number, and Primary Care Trust (PCT, Health Board in Scotland, Local Health Board in Wales) are also necessary. In addition, the surgery telephone number should be printed.</li>
      <li>When prescriptions are to be signed by general practitioner registrars, assistants, locums, or deputising doctors, the name of the doctor printed at the bottom of the form must still be that of the responsible principal.</li>
      <li>Names of medicines must come from a dictionary held in the computer memory, to provide a check on the spelling and to ensure that the name is written in full. The computer can be programmed to recognise both the non-proprietary and the proprietary name of a particular drug and to print out the preferred choice, but must not print out both names. For medicines not in the dictionary, separate checks are required—the user must be warned that no check was possible and the entire prescription must be entered in the lexicon.</li>
      <li>The dictionary may contain information on the usual doses, formulations, and pack sizes to produce standard predetermined prescriptions for common preparations, and to provide a check on the validity of an individual prescription on entry.</li>
      <li>The prescription must be printed in English without abbreviation; information may be entered or stored in abbreviated form. The dose must be in numbers, the frequency in words, and the quantity in numbers in brackets, thus: 40 mg four times daily (112). It must also be possible to prescribe by indicating the length of treatment required.</li>
      <li>The BNF recommendations should be followed as listed above.</li>
      <li>Checks may be incorporated to ensure that all the information required for dispensing a particular drug has been filled in. For instructions such as ‘as directed’ and ‘when required’, the maximum daily dose should normally be specified.</li>
      <li>Numbers and codes used in the system for organising and retrieving data must never appear on the form.</li>
      <li>Supplementary warnings or advice should be written in full, should not interfere with the clarity of the prescription itself, and should be in line with any warnings or advice in the BNF; numerical codes should not be used.</li>
      <li>A mechanism (such as printing a series of nonspecific characters) should be incorporated to cancel out unused space, or wording such as ‘no more items on this prescription’ may be added after the last item. Otherwise the doctor should delete the space manually.</li>
      <li>To avoid forgery the computer may print on the form the number of items to be dispensed (somewhere separate from the box for the pharmacist). The number of items per form need be limited only by the ability of the printer to produce clear and well-demarcated instructions with sufficient space for each item and a spacer line before each fresh item.</li>
      <li>Handwritten alterations should only be made in exceptional circumstances—it is preferable to print out a new prescription. Any alterations must be made in the doctor’s own handwriting and countersigned; computer records should be updated to fully reflect any alteration.

      <li>Prescriptions for controlled drugs can be printed from the computer, but the prescriber’s signature must be handwritten (See Controlled Drugs and Drug Dependence; the prescriber may use a date stamp).</li>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Yellow card scheme</p>
    <p>Any drug may produce unwanted or unexpected adverse reactions. Rapid detection and recording of adverse drug reactions is of vital importance so that unrecognised hazards are identified promptly and appropriate regulatory action is taken to ensure that medicines are used safely. Healthcare professionals and coroners are urged to report suspected adverse drug reactions directly to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) through the Yellow Card Scheme using the electronic form at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\">www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard</xref>. Alternatively, prepaid Yellow Cards for reporting are available from the address below and are also bound in the inside back cover of the <i>BNF</i>.</p>
    <p>Send Yellow Cards to:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Suspected adverse drug reactions to any therapeutic agent should be reported, including drugs (<i>self-medication</i> as well as those <i>prescribed</i>), blood products, vaccines, radiographic contrast media, complementary and herbal products. For biosimilar medicines and vaccines, adverse reaction reports should clearly state the brand name and the batch number of the suspected medicine or vaccine.</p>
    <p>Suspected adverse drug reactions should be reported through the Yellow Card Scheme at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\">www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard</xref>. Yellow Cards can be used for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions to medicines, vaccines, herbal or complementary products, whether self-medicated or prescribed. This includes suspected adverse drug reactions associated with misuse, overdose, medication errors or from use of unlicensed and off-label medicines. Yellow Cards can also be used to report medical device incidents, defective medicines, and suspected fake medicines.</p>
    <p>Spontaneous reporting is particularly valuable for recognising possible new hazards rapidly. An adverse reaction should be reported even if it is not certain that the drug has caused it, or if the reaction is well recognised, or if other drugs have been given at the same time. Reports of overdoses (deliberate or accidental) can complicate the assessment of adverse drug reactions, but provide important information on the potential toxicity of drugs.</p>
    <p>A freephone service is available to all parts of the UK for advice and information on suspected adverse drug reactions; contact the National Yellow Card Information Service at the MHRA on 0800 731 6789. Outside office hours a telephone-answering machine will take messages.</p>

    <p>The MHRA’s database facilitates the monitoring of adverse drug reactions. More detailed information on reporting and a list of products currently under additional monitoring can be found on the MHRA website: <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk\">www.mhra.gov.uk</xref>.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">MHRA Drug Safety Update</p>
      <p>
        <i>Drug Safety Update</i> is a monthly newsletter from the MHRA and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM); it is available at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/drugsafetyupdate\">www.mhra.gov.uk/drugsafetyupdate</xref>.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Self-reporting</p>
    <p>Patients and their carers can also report suspected adverse drug reactions to the MHRA. Reports can be submitted directly to the MHRA through the Yellow Card Scheme using the electronic form at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\">www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard</xref>, by telephone on 0808 100 3352, or by downloading the Yellow Card form from <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk\">www.mhra.gov.uk</xref>. Alternatively, patient Yellow Cards are available from pharmacies and GP surgeries. Information for patients about the Yellow Card Scheme is available in other languages at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\">www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard</xref>.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Prescription-event monitoring</p>
    <p>In addition to the MHRA’s Yellow Card Scheme, an independent scheme monitors the safety of new medicines using a different approach. The Drug Safety Research Unit identifies patients who have been prescribed selected new medicines and collects data on clinical events in these patients. The data are submitted on a voluntary basis by general practitioners on green forms. More information about the scheme and the Unit’s educational material is available from <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.dsru.org\">www.dsru.org</xref>.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Newer drugs and vaccines</p>
    <p>Only limited information is available from clinical trials on the safety of new medicines. Further understanding about the safety of medicines depends on the availability of information from routine clinical practice.</p>
    <p>The black triangle symbol identifies newly licensed medicines that require additional monitoring by the European Medicines Agency. Such medicines include new active substances, biosimilar medicines, and medicines that the European Medicines Agency consider require additional monitoring. The black triangle symbol also appears in the Patient Information Leaflets for relevant medicines, with a brief explanation of what it means. Products usually retain a black triangle for 5 years, but this can be extended if required.</p>
    <p>Spontaneous reporting is particularly valuable for recognising possible new hazards rapidly. For medicines showing the black triangle symbol, the MHRA asks that <b>all</b> suspected reactions (including those considered not to be serious) are reported through the Yellow Card Scheme. An adverse reaction should be reported even if it is not certain that the drug has caused it, or if the reaction is well recognised, or if other drugs have been given at the same time.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Established drugs and vaccines</p>
    <p>Healthcare professionals and coroners are asked to report all suspected reactions to established drugs (including over-the-counter, herbal, and unlicensed medicines and medicines used off-label) and vaccines that are <b>serious, medically significant, or result in harm</b>. Serious reactions include those that are fatal, life-threatening, disabling, incapacitating, or which result in or prolong hospitalisation, or a congenital abnormality; they should be reported even if the effect is well recognised. Examples include anaphylaxis, blood disorders, endocrine disturbances, effects on fertility, haemorrhage from any site, renal impairment, jaundice, ophthalmic disorders, severe CNS effects, severe skin reactions, reactions in pregnant women, and any drug interactions. Reports of serious adverse reactions are required to enable comparison with other drugs of a similar class. Reports of overdoses (deliberate or accidental) can complicate the assessment of adverse drug reactions, but provide important information on the potential toxicity of drugs.</p>
    <p>For established drugs there is no need to report well-known, relatively minor side-effects, such as dry mouth with tricyclic antidepressants or constipation with opioids.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Medication errors</p>
    <p>Adverse drug reactions where harm occurs as a result of a medication error are reportable as a Yellow Card or through the local risk management systems into the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). If reported to the NRLS, these will be shared with the MHRA. If the NRLS is not available and harm occurs, report using a Yellow Card.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Adverse reactions to medical devices</p>
    <p>Suspected adverse reactions to medical devices including dental or surgical materials, intra-uterine devices, and contact lens fluids should be reported. Information on reporting these can be found at: <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk\">www.mhra.gov.uk</xref>.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Side-effects in the BNF</p>
    <p>The BNF includes clinically relevant side-effects for most drugs; an exhaustive list is not included for drugs that are used by specialists (e.g. cytotoxic drugs and drugs used in anaesthesia). Where causality has not been established, side-effects in the manufacturers’ literature may be omitted from the BNF.</p>
    <p>Recognising that hypersensitivity reactions can occur with virtually all medicines, this effect is not generally listed, unless the drug carries an increased risk of such reactions. The BNF also omits effects that are likely to have little clinical consequence (e.g. transient increase in liver enzymes).</p>
    <p>Side-effects are generally listed in order of frequency and arranged broadly by body systems. Occasionally a rare side-effect might be listed first if it is considered to be particularly important because of its seriousness. In the product literature the frequency of side-effects is generally described as follows:</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Delayed drug effects</p>
      <p>Some reactions (e.g. cancers, chloroquine retinopathy, and retroperitoneal fibrosis) may become manifest months or years after exposure. Any suspicion of such an association should be reported directly to the MHRA through the Yellow Card Scheme.</p>

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Congenital abnormalities</p>
      <p>When an infant is born with a congenital abnormality or there is a malformed aborted fetus doctors are asked to consider whether this might be an adverse reaction to a drug and to report all drugs (including self-medication) taken during pregnancy.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Children</p>
      <p>Particular vigilance is required to identify and report adverse reactions in children, including those resulting from the unlicensed use of medicines; <b>all</b> suspected reactions should be reported directly to the MHRA through the Yellow Card Scheme (see also Adverse Drug Reactions in Children).</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Prevention of adverse reactions</p>
    <p>Adverse reactions may be prevented as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>never use any drug unless there is a good indication. If the patient is pregnant do not use a drug unless the need for it is imperative;</li>
      <li>allergy and idiosyncrasy are important causes of adverse drug reactions. Ask if the patient had previous reactions to the drug or formulation;</li>
      <li>ask if the patient is already taking other drugs including self-medication drugs, health supplements, complementary and alternative therapies; interactions may occur;</li>
      <li>age and hepatic or renal disease may alter the metabolism or excretion of drugs, so that much smaller doses may be needed. Genetic factors may also be responsible for variations in metabolism, and therefore for the adverse effect of the drug; notably of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref> and the tricyclic antidepressants;</li>
      <li>prescribe as few drugs as possible and give very clear instructions to the elderly or any patient likely to misunderstand complicated instructions;</li>
      <li>whenever possible use a familiar drug; with a new drug, be particularly alert for adverse reactions or unexpected events;</li>
      <li>consider if excipients (e.g. colouring agents) may be contributing to the adverse reaction. If the reaction is minor, a trial of an alternative formulation of the same drug may be considered before abandoning the drug;</li>
      <li>warn the patient if serious adverse reactions are liable to occur.</li>
    </ul>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Oral side-effects of drugs</p>
    <p>Drug-induced disorders of the mouth may be due to a local action on the mouth or to a systemic effect manifested by oral changes. In the latter case urgent referral to the patient’s medical practitioner may be necessary.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Oral mucosa</p>
      <p>Medicaments left in contact with or applied directly to the oral mucosa can lead to inflammation or ulceration; the possibility of allergy should also be borne in mind.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">Aspirin</xref> tablets allowed to dissolve in the sulcus for the treatment of toothache can lead to a white patch followed by ulceration.</p>
      <p>Flavouring agents, particularly <b>essential oils</b>, may sensitise the skin, but mucosal swelling is not usually prominent.</p>
      <p>The oral mucosa is particularly vulnerable to ulceration in patients treated with cytotoxic drugs, e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methotrexate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP533\">methotrexate</xref>. Other drugs capable of causing oral ulceration include <b>ACE inhibitors, gold, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nicorandil.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1387\">nicorandil</xref>, NSAIDs, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pancreatin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP732\">pancreatin</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/penicillamine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6302\">penicillamine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/proguanil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3954\">proguanil hydrochloride</xref>,</b> and <b>protease inhibitors</b>.</p>
      <p>Erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome may follow the use of a wide range of drugs including <b>antibacterials, antiretrovirals, sulfonamide derivatives,</b> and <b>anticonvulsants</b>; the oral mucosa may be extensively ulcerated, with characteristic target lesions on the skin. Oral lesions of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with a similar range of drugs. </p>
      <p>Lichenoid eruptions are associated with <b>ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs</b><xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methyldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1077\">methyldopa</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chloroquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3939\">chloroquine</xref>,<b>oral antidiabetics, thiazide diuretics,</b>and <b>gold</b>.</p>
      <p>Candidiasis can complicate treatment with <b>antibacterials</b> and <b>immunosuppressants</b> and is an occasional side-effect of <b>corticosteroid inhalers</b>.</p>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Teeth and jaw</p>
        <p>
          <i>Brown staining</i> of the teeth frequently follows the use of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlorhexidine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8126\">chlorhexidine</xref> mouthwash, spray or gel, but can readily be removed by polishing. <b>Iron</b> salts in liquid form can stain the enamel black. Superficial staining has been reported rarely with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-amoxiclav.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3337\">co-amoxiclav</xref> suspension.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Intrinsic staining</i> of the teeth is most commonly caused by <b>tetracyclines</b>. They will affect the teeth if given at any time from about the fourth month <i>in utero</i> until the age of twelve years; they are contra-indicated during pregnancy, in breast-feeding women, and in children under 12 years. All tetracyclines can cause permanent, unsightly staining in children, the colour varying from yellow to grey.</p>
        <p>Excessive ingestion of <b>fluoride</b> leads to <i>dental fluorosis</i> with mottling of the enamel and areas of hypoplasia or pitting; fluoride supplements occasionally cause mild mottling (white patches) if the dose is too large for the child’s age (taking into account the fluoride content of the local drinking water and of toothpaste).</p>
        <p>The risk of <i>osteonecrosis of the jaw</i> is substantially greater for patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonates in the treatment of cancer than for patients receiving oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or Paget’s disease. All patients receiving bisphosphonates should have a dental check-up (and any necessary remedial work should be performed) before bisphosphonate treatment, or as soon as possible after starting treatment. Patients with cancer receiving <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bevacizumab.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5436\">bevacizumab</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sunitinib.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5546\">sunitinib</xref> may also be at risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.</p>

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Periodontium</p>
      <p>
        <i>Gingival overgrowth</i> (gingival hyperplasia) is a side-effect of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/phenytoin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2958\">phenytoin</xref> and sometimes of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ciclosporin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP529\">ciclosporin</xref> or of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nifedipine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1353\">nifedipine</xref> (and some other calcium-channel blockers).</p>
      <p>
        <i>Thrombocytopenia</i> may be drug related and may cause bleeding at the gingival margins, which may be spontaneous or may follow mild trauma (such as toothbrushing).</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Salivary glands</p>
      <p>The most common effect that drugs have on the salivary glands is to <i>reduce flow</i> (xerostomia). Patients with a persistently dry mouth may have poor oral hygiene; they are at an increased risk of dental caries and oral infections (particularly candidiasis). Many drugs have been implicated in xerostomia, particularly <b>antimuscarinics</b> (anticholinergics), <b>antidepressants</b> (including tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), <b>alpha-blockers, antihistamines, antipsychotics, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/baclofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6720\">baclofen</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bupropion-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3190\">bupropion hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clonidine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1072\">clonidine hydrochloride</xref>, 5HT<sub>1</sub> agonists, opioids</b>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tizanidine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6731\">tizanidine</xref>. Excessive use of <b>diuretics</b> can also result in xerostomia.</p>
      <p>Some drugs (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clozapine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2273\">clozapine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/neostigmine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6699\">neostigmine</xref>) can <i>increase saliva production</i> but this is rarely a problem unless the patient has associated difficulty in swallowing.</p>
      <p>Pain in the salivary glands has been reported with some <b>antihypertensives</b> (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clonidine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1072\">clonidine hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methyldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1077\">methyldopa</xref>) and with <b>vinca alkaloids</b>.</p>
      <p>Swelling of the salivary glands can occur with <b>iodides, antithyroid drugs, phenothiazines,</b> and <b>sulfonamides</b>.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Taste</p>
      <p>There can be <i>decreased</i> taste acuity or <i>alteration</i> in taste sensation. Many drugs are implicated, including <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref>, <b> calcitonin, ACE inhibitors</b>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/carbimazole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4314\">carbimazole</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clarithromycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3505\">clarithromycin</xref>, <b>gold</b>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/griseofulvin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3736\">griseofulvin</xref>, <b>lithium salts</b>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metformin-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4161\">metformin hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metronidazole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3647\">metronidazole</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/penicillamine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6302\">penicillamine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/phenindione.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1501\">phenindione</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propafenone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP923\">propafenone hydrochloride</xref>, <b>protease inhibitors</b>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/terbinafine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3739\">terbinafine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/zopiclone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2124\">zopiclone</xref>.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Defective medicines</p>
    <p>During the manufacture or distribution of a medicine an error or accident may occur whereby the finished product does not conform to its specification. While such a defect may impair the therapeutic effect of the product and could adversely affect the health of a patient, it should <b>not</b> be confused with an Adverse Drug Reaction where the product conforms to its specification.</p>
    <p>The Defective Medicines Report Centre assists with the investigation of problems arising from licensed medicinal products thought to be defective and co-ordinates any necessary protective action. Reports on suspect defective medicinal products should include the brand or the non-proprietary name, the name of the manufacturer or supplier, the strength and dosage form of the product, the product licence number, the batch number or numbers of the product, the nature of the defect, and an account of any action already taken in consequence.

Any drug may produce unwanted or unexpected adverse reactions. Rapid detection and recording of adverse drug reactions is of vital importance so that unrecognised hazards are identified promptly and appropriate regulatory action is taken to ensure that medicines are used safely. Healthcare professionals and coroners are urged to report suspected adverse drug reactions directly to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) through the Yellow Card Scheme using the electronic form at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. Alternatively, prepaid Yellow Cards for reporting are available from the address below and are also bound in the inside back cover of the BNF.

FREEPOST YELLOW CARD(No other address details required).

0800 731 6789Suspected adverse drug reactions to any therapeutic agent should be reported, including drugs (self-medication as well as those prescribed), blood products, vaccines, radiographic contrast media, complementary and herbal products. For biosimilar medicines and vaccines, adverse reaction reports should clearly state the brand name and the batch number of the suspected medicine or vaccine.

Suspected adverse drug reactions should be reported through the Yellow Card Scheme at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. Yellow Cards can be used for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions to medicines, vaccines, herbal or complementary products, whether self-medicated or prescribed. This includes suspected adverse drug reactions associated with misuse, overdose, medication errors or from use of unlicensed and off-label medicines. Yellow Cards can also be used to report medical device incidents, defective medicines, and suspected fake medicines.

Spontaneous reporting is particularly valuable for recognising possible new hazards rapidly. An adverse reaction should be reported even if it is not certain that the drug has caused it, or if the reaction is well recognised, or if other drugs have been given at the same time. Reports of overdoses (deliberate or accidental) can complicate the assessment of adverse drug reactions, but provide important information on the potential toxicity of drugs.

A freephone service is available to all parts of the UK for advice and information on suspected adverse drug reactions; contact the National Yellow Card Information Service at the MHRA on 0800 731 6789. Outside office hours a telephone-answering machine will take messages.

More detailed information on reporting and a list of products currently under additional monitoring can be found on the MHRA website: www.mhra.gov.uk.

MHRA Drug Safety Update

Drug Safety Update is a monthly newsletter from the MHRA and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM); it is available at www.mhra.gov.uk/drugsafetyupdate.

Self-reporting

Patients and their carers can also report suspected adverse drug reactions to the MHRA. Reports can be submitted directly to the MHRA through the Yellow Card Scheme using the electronic form at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard, by telephone on 0808 100 3352, or by downloading the Yellow Card form from www.mhra.gov.uk. Alternatively, patient Yellow Cards are available from pharmacies and GP surgeries. Information for patients about the Yellow Card Scheme is available in other languages at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard.

Prescription-event monitoring

In addition to the MHRA’s Yellow Card Scheme, an independent scheme monitors the safety of new medicines using a different approach. The Drug Safety Research Unit identifies patients who have been prescribed selected new medicines and collects data on clinical events in these patients. The data are submitted on a voluntary basis by general practitioners on green forms. More information about the scheme and the Unit’s educational material is available from www.dsru.org.

Newer drugs and vaccines

Only limited information is available from clinical trials on the safety of new medicines. Further understanding about the safety of medicines depends on the availability of information from routine clinical practice.

The black triangle symbol identifies newly licensed medicines that require additional monitoring by the European Medicines Agency. Such medicines include new active substances, biosimilar medicines, and medicines that the European Medicines Agency consider require additional monitoring. The black triangle symbol also appears in the Patient Information Leaflets for relevant medicines, with a brief explanation of what it means. Products usually retain a black triangle for 5 years, but this can be extended if required.

Spontaneous reporting is particularly valuable for recognising possible new hazards rapidly. For medicines showing the black triangle symbol, the MHRA asks that all suspected reactions (including those considered not to be serious) are reported through the Yellow Card Scheme. An adverse reaction should be reported even if it is not certain that the drug has caused it, or if the reaction is well recognised, or if other drugs have been given at the same time.

Established drugs and vaccines

Healthcare professionals and coroners are asked to report all suspected reactions to established drugs (including over-the-counter, herbal, and unlicensed medicines and medicines used off-label) and vaccines that are serious, medically significant, or result in harm. Serious reactions include those that are fatal, life-threatening, disabling, incapacitating, or which result in or prolong hospitalisation, or a congenital abnormality; they should be reported even if the effect is well recognised. Examples include anaphylaxis, blood disorders, endocrine disturbances, effects on fertility, haemorrhage from any site, renal impairment, jaundice, ophthalmic disorders, severe CNS effects, severe skin reactions, reactions in pregnant women, and any drug interactions. Reports of serious adverse reactions are required to enable comparison with other drugs of a similar class. Reports of overdoses (deliberate or accidental) can complicate the assessment of adverse drug reactions, but provide important information on the potential toxicity of drugs.

For established drugs there is no need to report well-known, relatively minor side-effects, such as dry mouth with tricyclic antidepressants or constipation with opioids.

Medication errors

Adverse drug reactions where harm occurs as a result of a medication error are reportable as a Yellow Card or through the local risk management systems into the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). If reported to the NRLS, these will be shared with the MHRA. If the NRLS is not available and harm occurs, report using a Yellow Card.

Adverse reactions to medical devices

Suspected adverse reactions to medical devices including dental or surgical materials, intra-uterine devices, and contact lens fluids should be reported. Information on reporting these can be found at: www.mhra.gov.uk.

Side-effects in the BNF

The BNF includes clinically relevant side-effects for most drugs; an exhaustive list is not included for drugs that are used by specialists (e.g. cytotoxic drugs and drugs used in anaesthesia). Where causality has not been established, side-effects in the manufacturers’ literature may be omitted from the BNF.

Recognising that hypersensitivity reactions can occur with virtually all medicines, this effect is not generally listed, unless the drug carries an increased risk of such reactions. The BNF also omits effects that are likely to have little clinical consequence (e.g. transient increase in liver enzymes).

Side-effects are generally listed in order of frequency and arranged broadly by body systems. Occasionally a rare side-effect might be listed first if it is considered to be particularly important because of its seriousness. In the product literature the frequency of side-effects is generally described as follows:

Description of the frequency of side-effectsVery commongreater than 1 in 10Common1 in 100 to 1 in 10Uncommon [formerly 'less commonly' in BNF publications]1 in 1000 to 1 in 100Rare1 in 10 000 to 1 in 1000Very rareless than 1 in 10 000Special problems

Delayed drug effects

Some reactions (e.g. cancers, chloroquine retinopathy, and retroperitoneal fibrosis) may become manifest months or years after exposure. Any suspicion of such an association should be reported directly to the MHRA through the Yellow Card Scheme.

The elderly

Particular vigilance is required to identify adverse reactions in the elderly.

Congenital abnormalities

When an infant is born with a congenital abnormality or there is a malformed aborted fetus doctors are asked to consider whether this might be an adverse reaction to a drug and to report all drugs (including self-medication) taken during pregnancy.

Children

Particular vigilance is required to identify and report adverse reactions in children, including those resulting from the unlicensed use of medicines; all suspected reactions should be reported directly to the MHRA through the Yellow Card Scheme (see also Adverse Drug Reactions in Children).

Prevention of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions may be prevented as follows:

never use any drug unless there is a good indication. If the patient is pregnant do not use a drug unless the need for it is imperative;allergy and idiosyncrasy are important causes of adverse drug reactions. Ask if the patient had previous reactions to the drug or formulation;ask if the patient is already taking other drugs including self-medication drugs, health supplements, complementary and alternative therapies; interactions may occur;age and hepatic or renal disease may alter the metabolism or excretion of drugs, so that much smaller doses may be needed. Genetic factors may also be responsible for variations in metabolism, and therefore for the adverse effect of the drug; notably of isoniazid and the tricyclic antidepressants;prescribe as few drugs as possible and give very clear instructions to the elderly or any patient likely to misunderstand complicated instructions;whenever possible use a familiar drug; with a new drug, be particularly alert for adverse reactions or unexpected events;consider if excipients (e.g. colouring agents) may be contributing to the adverse reaction. If the reaction is minor, a trial of an alternative formulation of the same drug may be considered before abandoning the drug;warn the patient if serious adverse reactions are liable to occur.Oral side-effects of drugs

Drug-induced disorders of the mouth may be due to a local action on the mouth or to a systemic effect manifested by oral changes. In the latter case urgent referral to the patient’s medical practitioner may be necessary.

Oral mucosa

Medicaments left in contact with or applied directly to the oral mucosa can lead to inflammation or ulceration; the possibility of allergy should also be borne in mind.

Aspirin tablets allowed to dissolve in the sulcus for the treatment of toothache can lead to a white patch followed by ulceration.

Flavouring agents, particularly essential oils, may sensitise the skin, but mucosal swelling is not usually prominent.

The oral mucosa is particularly vulnerable to ulceration in patients treated with cytotoxic drugs, e.g. methotrexate. Other drugs capable of causing oral ulceration include ACE inhibitors, gold, nicorandil, NSAIDs, pancreatin, penicillamine, proguanil hydrochloride, and protease inhibitors.

Erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome may follow the use of a wide range of drugs including antibacterials, antiretrovirals, sulfonamide derivatives, and anticonvulsants; the oral mucosa may be extensively ulcerated, with characteristic target lesions on the skin. Oral lesions of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with a similar range of drugs. 

Lichenoid eruptions are associated with ACE inhibitors, NSAIDsmethyldopa, chloroquine,oral antidiabetics, thiazide diuretics,and gold.

Candidiasis can complicate treatment with antibacterials and immunosuppressants and is an occasional side-effect of corticosteroid inhalers.

Teeth and jaw

Brown staining of the teeth frequently follows the use of chlorhexidine mouthwash, spray or gel, but can readily be removed by polishing. Iron salts in liquid form can stain the enamel black. Superficial staining has been reported rarely with co-amoxiclav suspension.

Intrinsic staining of the teeth is most commonly caused by tetracyclines. They will affect the teeth if given at any time from about the fourth month in utero until the age of twelve years; they are contra-indicated during pregnancy, in breast-feeding women, and in children under 12 years. All tetracyclines can cause permanent, unsightly staining in children, the colour varying from yellow to grey.

Excessive ingestion of fluoride leads to dental fluorosis with mottling of the enamel and areas of hypoplasia or pitting; fluoride supplements occasionally cause mild mottling (white patches) if the dose is too large for the child’s age (taking into account the fluoride content of the local drinking water and of toothpaste).

The risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw is substantially greater for patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonates in the treatment of cancer than for patients receiving oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or Paget’s disease. All patients receiving bisphosphonates should have a dental check-up (and any necessary remedial work should be performed) before bisphosphonate treatment, or as soon as possible after starting treatment. Patients with cancer receiving bevacizumab or sunitinib may also be at risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

Periodontium

Gingival overgrowth (gingival hyperplasia) is a side-effect of phenytoin and sometimes of ciclosporin or of nifedipine (and some other calcium-channel blockers).

Thrombocytopenia may be drug related and may cause bleeding at the gingival margins, which may be spontaneous or may follow mild trauma (such as toothbrushing).

Salivary glands

The most common effect that drugs have on the salivary glands is to reduce flow (xerostomia). Patients with a persistently dry mouth may have poor oral hygiene; they are at an increased risk of dental caries and oral infections (particularly candidiasis). Many drugs have been implicated in xerostomia, particularly antimuscarinics (anticholinergics), antidepressants (including tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), alpha-blockers, antihistamines, antipsychotics, baclofen, bupropion hydrochloride, clonidine hydrochloride, 5HT1 agonists, opioids, and tizanidine. Excessive use of diuretics can also result in xerostomia.

Some drugs (e.g. clozapine, neostigmine) can increase saliva production but this is rarely a problem unless the patient has associated difficulty in swallowing.

Pain in the salivary glands has been reported with some antihypertensives (e.g. clonidine hydrochloride, methyldopa) and with vinca alkaloids.

Swelling of the salivary glands can occur with iodides, antithyroid drugs, phenothiazines, and sulfonamides.

Taste

There can be decreased taste acuity or alteration in taste sensation. Many drugs are implicated, including amiodarone hydrochloride,  calcitonin, ACE inhibitors, carbimazole, clarithromycin, gold, griseofulvin, lithium salts, metformin hydrochloride, metronidazole, penicillamine, phenindione, propafenone hydrochloride, protease inhibitors, terbinafine, and zopiclone.

Defective medicines

During the manufacture or distribution of a medicine an error or accident may occur whereby the finished product does not conform to its specification. While such a defect may impair the therapeutic effect of the product and could adversely affect the health of a patient, it should not be confused with an Adverse Drug Reaction where the product conforms to its specification.

The Defective Medicines Report Centre assists with the investigation of problems arising from licensed medicinal products thought to be defective and co-ordinates any necessary protective action. Reports on suspect defective medicinal products should include the brand or the non-proprietary name, the name of the manufacturer or supplier, the strength and dosage form of the product, the product licence number, the batch number or numbers of the product, the nature of the defect, and an account of any action already taken in consequence.

    <p>The total daily maintenance dose of a drug can be reduced either by reducing the size of the individual doses or by increasing the interval between doses.

The use of drugs in patients with reduced renal function can give rise to problems for several reasons:

reduced renal excretion of a drug or its metabolites may cause toxicity;sensitivity to some drugs is increased even if elimination is unimpaired;many side-effects are tolerated poorly by patients with renal impairment;some drugs are not effective when renal function is reduced.Many of these problems can be avoided by reducing the dose or by using alternative drugs.

Principles of dose adjustment in renal impairment

The level of renal function below which the dose of a drug must be reduced depends on the proportion of the drug eliminated by renal excretion and its toxicity.

For many drugs with only minor or no dose-related side-effects very precise modification of the dose regimen is unnecessary and a simple scheme for dose reduction is sufficient.

For more toxic drugs with a small safety margin or patients at extremes of weight, dose regimens based on creatinine clearance should be used. When both efficacy and toxicity are closely related to plasma-drug concentration, recommended regimens should be regarded only as a guide to initial treatment; subsequent doses must be adjusted according to clinical response and plasma-drug concentration.

Renal function declines with age; many elderly patients have renal impairment but, because of reduced muscle mass, this may not be indicated by a raised serum creatinine. It is wise to assume at least mild impairment of renal function when prescribing for the elderly.

The total daily maintenance dose of a drug can be reduced either by reducing the size of the individual doses or by increasing the interval between doses. For some drugs, although the size of the maintenance dose is reduced it is important to give a loading dose if an immediate effect is required. This is because it takes about five times the half-life of the drug to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations. Because the plasma half-life of drugs excreted by the kidney is prolonged in renal impairment it can take many doses for the reduced dosage to achieve a therapeutic plasma concentration. The loading dose should usually be the same size as the initial dose for a patient with normal renal function.

Nephrotoxic drugs should, if possible, be avoided in patients with renal disease because the consequences of nephrotoxicity are likely to be more serious when renal reserve is already reduced.

Dose recommendations are based on the severity of renal impairment.

Renal function is measured either in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from a formula derived from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (‘MDRD formula’ that uses serum creatinine, age, sex, and race (for Afro-Caribbean patients)) or it can be expressed as creatinine clearance (best derived from a 24-hour urine collection but often calculated from the Cockcroft and Gault formula (CG).

Cockcroft and Gault Formula

Estimated Creatinine Clearance in mL/minute = ((140 - Age) x Weight x Constant)/Serum creatinineAge in yearsWeight in kilograms; use ideal body-weightSerum creatinine in micromol/litreConstant = 1.23 for men; 1.04 for womenThe serum-creatinine concentration is sometimes used instead as a measure of renal function but it is only a rough guide to drug dosing.

Important

Renal function in adults is increasingly being reported on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) normalised to a body surface area of 1.73 m2 and derived from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. However, published information on the effects of renal impairment on drug elimination is usually stated in terms of creatinine clearance as a surrogate for glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

The information on dosage adjustment in the BNF is expressed in terms of eGFR, rather than creatinine clearance, for most drugs (exceptions include toxic drugs and patients at extremes of weight). Although the two measures of renal function are not interchangeable, in practice, for most drugs and for most patients (over 18 years) of average build and height, eGFR (MDRD ‘formula’) can be used to determine dosage adjustments in place of creatinine clearance. An individual’s absolute glomerular filtration rate can be calculated from the eGFR as follows: GFR Absolute = eGFR x (individual’s body surface area/1.73)

Toxic drugs

For potentially toxic drugs with a small safety margin, creatinine clearance (calculated from the Cockcroft and Gault formula) should be used to adjust drug dosages in addition to plasma-drug concentration and clinical response.

Patients at extremes of weight

In patients at both extremes of weight (BMI of less than 18.5 kg/ m2 or greater than 30 kg/m2) the absolute glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance (calculated from the Cockcroft and Gault formula) should be used to adjust drug dosages.

In the BNF, values for eGFR, creatinine clearance (for toxic drugs), or another measure of renal function are included where possible. However, where such values are not available, the BNF reflects the terms used in the published information.

If even mild renal impairment is considered likely on clinical grounds, renal function should be checked before prescribing any drug which requires dose modification.

Where care is needed when prescribing in renal impairment, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF.

Dialysis

For prescribing in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or haemodialysis, consult specialist literature.

    <p>The principal legal requirements relating to medical prescriptions are listed below (see also Department of Health Guidance).</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Prescription requirements</p>
      <p>Prescriptions for Controlled Drugs that are subject to prescription requirements, (all preparations in Schedules 2 and 3, must be indelible, (a machine-written prescription is acceptable; the prescriber’s signature must be handwritten), and must be <i>signed</i> by the prescriber, be <i>dated</i>, and specify the prescriber’s <i>address</i>. The prescription must always state:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the name and address of the patient;</li>
        <li>in the case of a preparation, the form, (the dosage form e.g. tablets must be included on a Controlled Drugs prescription irrespective of whether it is implicit in the proprietary name e.g. <i>MST Continus</i> or whether only one form is available), and where appropriate the strength of the preparation (when more than one strength of a preparation exists the strength required must be specified);</li>
        <li>for liquids, the total volume in millilitres (in both words and figures) of the preparation to be supplied; for dosage units, the number (in both words and figures) of dosage units to be supplied; in any other case, the total quantity (in both words and figures) of the Controlled Drug to be supplied;</li>
        <li>the dose (the instruction ‘one as directed’ constitutes a dose but ‘as directed’ does not);</li>
        <li>the words ‘for dental treatment only’ if issued by a dentist.</li>
      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
    <p>A pharmacist is <b>not</b> allowed to dispense a Controlled Drug unless all the information required by law is given on the prescription. In the case of a prescription for a Controlled Drug in Schedule 2 or 3, a pharmacist can amend the prescription if it specifies the total quantity only in words or in figures or if it contains minor typographical errors, provided that such amendments are indelible and clearly attributable to the pharmacist (implementation date for <i>N. Ireland</i> not confirmed). Failure to comply with the regulations concerning the writing of prescriptions will result in inconvenience to patients and carers and delay in supplying the necessary medicine. A prescription for a Controlled Drug in Schedules 2, 3, or 4 is valid for 28 days from the date stated thereon (the prescriber may forward-date the prescription; the start date may also be specified in the body of the prescription).</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>

    <p>
      <b>Cannabis</b> (Indian hemp) has no approved medicinal use and cannot be prescribed by doctors. Its use is illegal but widespread. Cannabis is a mild hallucinogen seldom accompanied by a desire to increase the dose; withdrawal symptoms are unusual. However, cannabis extract is licensed as a medicinal product. <b>Lysergide</b> (lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD) is a much more potent hallucinogen; its use can lead to severe psychotic states which can be life-threatening.</p>
    <p>There are concerns over increases in the availability and misuse of other drugs with variously combined hallucinogenic, anaesthetic, or sedative properties.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Prescribing drugs likely to cause dependence or misuse</p>
    <p>The prescriber has three main responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To avoid creating dependence by introducing drugs to patients without sufficient reason. In this context, the proper use of the morphine-like drugs is well understood. The dangers of other Controlled Drugs are less clear because recognition of dependence is not easy and its effects, and those of withdrawal, are less obvious.</li>
      <li>To see that the patient does not gradually increase the dose of a drug, given for good medical reasons, to the point where dependence becomes more likely. This tendency is seen especially with hypnotics and anxiolytics. The prescriber should keep a close eye on the amount prescribed to prevent patients from accumulating stocks. A minimal amount should be prescribed in the first instance, or when seeing a new patient for the first time.</li>
      <li>To avoid being used as an unwitting source of supply for addicts and being vigilant to methods for obtaining medicines. Methods include visiting more than one doctor, fabricating stories, and forging prescriptions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patients under temporary care should be given only small supplies of drugs unless they present an unequivocal letter from their own doctor. Doctors should also remember that their own patients may be attempting to collect prescriptions from other prescribers, especially in hospitals. It is sensible to reduce dosages steadily or to issue weekly or even daily prescriptions for small amounts if it is apparent that dependence is occurring.</p>
    <p>The stealing and misuse of prescription forms could be minimised by the following precautions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>do not leave unattended if called away from the consulting room or at reception desks; do not leave in a car where they may be visible; when not in use, keep in a locked drawer within the surgery and at home;</li>
      <li>draw a diagonal line across the blank part of the form under the prescription;</li>
      <li>write the quantity in words and figures when prescribing drugs prone to abuse; this is obligatory for controlled drugs;</li>
      <li>alterations are best avoided but if any are made they should be clear and unambiguous; add initials against altered items;</li>
      <li>if prescriptions are left for collection they should be left in a safe place in a sealed envelope.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Applications for licences should be sent to the Home Office, Drugs Licensing &amp; Compliance Unit, Fry Building, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.</p>
    <p> Alternatively, completed application forms can be emailed to dlcucommsofficer@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk with a copy of the covering letter from the prescriber as a pdf. A minimum of two weeks should be allowed for processing the application.</p>
    <p>Patients travelling for less than 3 months do not require a personal export/import licence for carrying Controlled Drugs, but are advised to carry a letter from the prescribing doctor. Those travelling for more than 3 months are advised to make arrangements to have their medication prescribed by a practitioner in the country they are visiting.</p>
    <p>Doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad while accompanying patients may similarly be issued with licences. Licences are not normally issued to doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad solely in case a family emergency should arise.</p>
    <p>Personal export/import licences do not have any legal status outside the UK and are issued only to comply with the Misuse of Drugs Act and to facilitate passage through UK Customs and Excise control.

The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971 prohibits certain activities in relation to ‘Controlled Drugs’, in particular their manufacture, supply, and possession. The penalties applicable to offences involving the different drugs are graded broadly according to the harmfulness attributable to a drug when it is misused and for this purpose the drugs are defined in the following three classes:

Class A includes: alfentanil, cocaine, diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin), dipipanone hydrochloride, lysergide (LSD), methadone hydrochloride, methylenedioxymethamfetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy’), morphine, opium, pethidine hydrochloride, phencyclidine, remifentanil, and class B substances when prepared for injection.Class B includes: oral amfetamines, barbiturates, cannabis, cannabis resin, codeine phosphate, ethylmorphine, glutethimide, ketamine, nabilone, pentazocine phenmetrazine, and pholcodine.Class C includes: certain drugs related to the amfetamines such as benzfetamine and chlorphentermine, buprenorphine, diethylpropion, mazindol, meprobamate pemoline, pipradrol, most benzodiazepines, tramadol hydrochloride, zaleplon, zolpidem tartrate, zopiclone, androgenic and anabolic steroids, clenbuterol, chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), non-human chorionic gonadotrophin, somatotropin, somatrem, and somatropin.The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (and subsequent amendments) define the classes of person who are authorised to supply and possess controlled drugs while acting in their professional capacities and lay down the conditions under which these activities may be carried out. In the regulations drugs are divided into five schedules each specifying the requirements governing such activities as import, export, production, supply, possession, prescribing, and record keeping which apply to them.

Schedule 1 includes drugs such as lysergide which is not used medicinally. Possession and supply are prohibited except in accordance with Home Office authority.Schedule 2 includes drugs such as diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin), morphine, nabilone, remifentanil, pethidine hydrochloride, secobarbital, glutethimide, the amfetamines, sodium oxybate and cocaine and are subject to the full controlled drug requirements relating to prescriptions, safe custody (except for secobarbital), the need to keep registers, etc. (unless exempted in Schedule 5).Schedule 3 includes the barbiturates (except secobarbital, now Schedule 2), buprenorphine, diethylpropion, mazindol, meprobamate, midazolam, pentazocine, phentermine, temazepam, and tramadol hydrochloride. They are subject to the special prescription requirements. Safe custody requirements do apply, except for any 5,5 disubstituted barbituric acid (e.g. phenobarbital), mazindol, meprobamate, midazolam, pentazocine, phentermine, tramadol hydrochloride, or any stereoisomeric form or salts of the above. Records in registers do not need to be kept (although there are requirements for the retention of invoices for 2 years).Schedule 4 includes in Part I benzodiazepines (except temazepam and midazolam, which are in Schedule 3), zaleplon, zolpidem tartrate, and zopiclone which are subject to minimal control. Part II includes androgenic and anabolic steroids, clenbuterol, chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), non-human chorionic gonadotrophin, somatotropin, somatrem, and somatropin. Controlled drug prescription requirements do not apply and Schedule 4 Controlled Drugs are not subject to safe custody requirements.Schedule 5 includes those preparations which, because of their strength, are exempt from virtually all Controlled Drug requirements other than retention of invoices for two years.Prescriptions

Preparations in Schedules 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (and subsequent amendments) are identified throughout the BNF and BNF for children using the following symbols:

for preparations in Schedule 1for preparations in Schedule 2for preparations in Schedule 3for preparations in Schedule 4 (Part I)for preparations in Schedule 4 (Part II)The principal legal requirements relating to medical prescriptions are listed below (see also Department of Health Guidance).

Prescription requirements

Prescriptions for Controlled Drugs that are subject to prescription requirements, (all preparations in Schedules 2 and 3, must be indelible, (a machine-written prescription is acceptable; the prescriber’s signature must be handwritten), and must be signed by the prescriber, be dated, and specify the prescriber’s address. The prescription must always state:

the name and address of the patient;in the case of a preparation, the form, (the dosage form e.g. tablets must be included on a Controlled Drugs prescription irrespective of whether it is implicit in the proprietary name e.g. MST Continus or whether only one form is available), and where appropriate the strength of the preparation (when more than one strength of a preparation exists the strength required must be specified);for liquids, the total volume in millilitres (in both words and figures) of the preparation to be supplied; for dosage units, the number (in both words and figures) of dosage units to be supplied; in any other case, the total quantity (in both words and figures) of the Controlled Drug to be supplied;the dose (the instruction ‘one as directed’ constitutes a dose but ‘as directed’ does not);the words ‘for dental treatment only’ if issued by a dentist.A pharmacist is not allowed to dispense a Controlled Drug unless all the information required by law is given on the prescription. In the case of a prescription for a Controlled Drug in Schedule 2 or 3, a pharmacist can amend the prescription if it specifies the total quantity only in words or in figures or if it contains minor typographical errors, provided that such amendments are indelible and clearly attributable to the pharmacist (implementation date for N. Ireland not confirmed). Failure to comply with the regulations concerning the writing of prescriptions will result in inconvenience to patients and carers and delay in supplying the necessary medicine. A prescription for a Controlled Drug in Schedules 2, 3, or 4 is valid for 28 days from the date stated thereon (the prescriber may forward-date the prescription; the start date may also be specified in the body of the prescription).

Instalments and ‘repeats’

A prescription may order a Controlled Drug to be dispensed by instalments; the amount of instalments and the intervals to be observed must be specified. A total of 14 days’ treatment by instalment of any drug listed in Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, buprenorphine, and diazepam may be prescribed in England. In England, forms FP10(MDA) (blue) and FP10H(MDA) (blue) should be used. In Scotland, forms GP10 (peach), HBP (blue), or HBPA (pink) should be used. In Wales a total of 14 days’ treatment by instalment of any drug listed in Schedules 2–5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations may be prescribed. In Wales, form WP10(MDA) or form WP10HP(AD) should be used.

Instalment prescriptions must be dispensed in accordance with the directions in the prescription. However, the Home Office has approved specific wording which may be included in an instalment prescription to cover certain situations; for example, if a pharmacy is closed on the day when an instalment is due. For details, see Medicines, Ethics and Practice, London, Pharmaceutical Press (always consult latest edition) or see Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management (2007), available at www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/clinical_guidelines_2007.pdf.

Prescriptions ordering ‘repeats’ on the same form are not permitted for Controlled Drugs in Schedules 2 or 3.

Private prescriptions

Private prescriptions for Controlled Drugs in Schedules 2 and 3 must be written on specially designated forms provided by Primary Care Trusts in England, Health Boards in Scotland, Local Health Boards in Wales, or the Northern Ireland Central Services Agency; in addition, prescriptions must specify the prescriber’s identification number. Prescriptions to be supplied by a pharmacist in hospital are exempt from the requirements for private prescriptions.

Department of Health guidance

Guidance (June 2006) issued by the Department of Health in England on prescribing and dispensing of Controlled Drugs requires:

in general, prescriptions for Controlled Drugs in Schedules 2, 3, and 4 to be limited to a supply of up to 30 days’ treatment; exceptionally, to cover a justifiable clinical need and after consideration of any risk, a prescription can be issued for a longer period, but the reasons for the decision should be recorded on the patient’s notes;the patient’s identifier to be shown on NHS and private prescriptions for Controlled Drugs in Schedules 2 and 3.Further information is available at www.gov.uk/dh.

See sample prescription:

Specimen controlled drug prescriptionDependence and misuse

The most serious drugs of addiction are cocaine, diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin), morphine, and the synthetic opioids. For arrangements for prescribing of diamorphine, dipipanone, or cocaine for addicts, see Prescribing of diamorphine (heroin), dipipanone, and cocaine for addicts.

Despite marked reduction in the prescribing of amfetamines, there is concern that abuse of illicit amfetamine and related compounds is widespread.

Benzodiazepines are commonly misused. However, the misuse of barbiturates is now uncommon, in line with declining medicinal use and consequent availability.

Cannabis (Indian hemp) has no approved medicinal use and cannot be prescribed by doctors. Its use is illegal but widespread. Cannabis is a mild hallucinogen seldom accompanied by a desire to increase the dose; withdrawal symptoms are unusual. However, cannabis extract is licensed as a medicinal product. Lysergide (lysergic acid diethylamide, LSD) is a much more potent hallucinogen; its use can lead to severe psychotic states which can be life-threatening.

There are concerns over increases in the availability and misuse of other drugs with variously combined hallucinogenic, anaesthetic, or sedative properties. These include ketamine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (sodium oxybate, GHB).

Supervised consumption

Individuals prescribed opioid substitution therapy can take their daily dose under the supervision of a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist during the dose stabilisation phase (usually the first 3 months of treatment), after a relapse or period of instability, or if there is a significant increase in the dose of methadone. Supervised consumption should continue (in accordance with local protocols) until the prescriber is confident that the patient is compliant with their treatment.

Prescribing drugs likely to cause dependence or misuse

The prescriber has three main responsibilities:

To avoid creating dependence by introducing drugs to patients without sufficient reason. In this context, the proper use of the morphine-like drugs is well understood. The dangers of other Controlled Drugs are less clear because recognition of dependence is not easy and its effects, and those of withdrawal, are less obvious.To see that the patient does not gradually increase the dose of a drug, given for good medical reasons, to the point where dependence becomes more likely. This tendency is seen especially with hypnotics and anxiolytics. The prescriber should keep a close eye on the amount prescribed to prevent patients from accumulating stocks. A minimal amount should be prescribed in the first instance, or when seeing a new patient for the first time.To avoid being used as an unwitting source of supply for addicts and being vigilant to methods for obtaining medicines. Methods include visiting more than one doctor, fabricating stories, and forging prescriptions.Patients under temporary care should be given only small supplies of drugs unless they present an unequivocal letter from their own doctor. Doctors should also remember that their own patients may be attempting to collect prescriptions from other prescribers, especially in hospitals. It is sensible to reduce dosages steadily or to issue weekly or even daily prescriptions for small amounts if it is apparent that dependence is occurring.

The stealing and misuse of prescription forms could be minimised by the following precautions:

do not leave unattended if called away from the consulting room or at reception desks; do not leave in a car where they may be visible; when not in use, keep in a locked drawer within the surgery and at home;draw a diagonal line across the blank part of the form under the prescription;write the quantity in words and figures when prescribing drugs prone to abuse; this is obligatory for controlled drugs;alterations are best avoided but if any are made they should be clear and unambiguous; add initials against altered items;if prescriptions are left for collection they should be left in a safe place in a sealed envelope.Travelling abroad

Prescribed drugs listed in Schedule 4 Part II (CD Anab) and Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 are not subject to export or import licensing. However, patients intending to travel abroad for more than 3 months carrying any amount of drugs listed in Schedules 2, 3, or 4 Part I (CD Benz) will require a personal export/import licence. Further details can be obtained at www.gov.uk/controlled-drugs-licences-fees-andreturns or from the Home Office by contacting licensing_enquiry.aadu@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk. In cases of emergency, telephone (020) 7035 6330.

Applications must be supported by a covering letter from the prescriber and should give details of:

the patient’s name and address;the quantities of drugs to be carried;the strength and form in which the drugs will be dispensed;the country or countries of destination;the dates of travel to and from the United Kingdom.Applications for licences should be sent to the Home Office, Drugs Licensing & Compliance Unit, Fry Building, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.

 Alternatively, completed application forms can be emailed to dlcucommsofficer@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk with a copy of the covering letter from the prescriber as a pdf. A minimum of two weeks should be allowed for processing the application.

Patients travelling for less than 3 months do not require a personal export/import licence for carrying Controlled Drugs, but are advised to carry a letter from the prescribing doctor. Those travelling for more than 3 months are advised to make arrangements to have their medication prescribed by a practitioner in the country they are visiting.

Doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad while accompanying patients may similarly be issued with licences. Licences are not normally issued to doctors who want to take Controlled Drugs abroad solely in case a family emergency should arise.

Prescribing of diamorphine (heroin), dipipanone, and cocaine for addicts

The Misuse of Drugs (Supply to Addicts) Regulations 1997 require that only medical practitioners who hold a special licence issued by the Home Secretary may prescribe, administer, or supply diamorphine hydrochloride, dipipanone (Diconal), or cocaine in the treatment of drug addiction; other practitioners must refer any addict who requires these drugs to a treatment centre. Whenever possible the addict will be introduced by a member of staff from the treatment centre to a pharmacist whose agreement has been obtained and whose pharmacy is conveniently sited for the patient. Prescriptions for weekly supplies will be sent to the pharmacy by post and will be dispensed on a daily basis as indicated by the doctor. If any alterations of the arrangements are requested by the addict, the portion of the prescription affected must be represcribed and not merely altered.

General practitioners and other doctors do not require a special licence for prescribing diamorphine hydrochloride, dipipanone, and cocaine for patients (including addicts) for relieving pain from organic disease or injury.

If in doubt whether to report a suspected adverse drug reaction, please complete a Yellow Card.

The identification and reporting of adverse reactions to drugs in children and neonates is particularly important because:

If reported to the NRLS, these will be shared with the MHRA. If the NRLS is not available and harm occurs, report using a Yellow Card.

Prescription writing

Prescriptions should be written according to the guidelines in Prescription Writing. Inclusion of age is a legal requirement in the case of prescription-only medicines for children under 12 years of age, but it is preferable to state the age for all prescriptions for children.

It is particularly important to state the strengths of capsules or tablets. Although liquid preparations are particularly suitable for children, they may contain sugar which encourages dental decay. Sugar-free medicines are preferred for long-term treatment.

Many children are able to swallow tablets or capsules and may prefer a solid dose form; involving the child and parents in choosing the formulation is helpful.

When a prescription for a liquid oral preparation is written and the dose ordered is smaller than 5 mL an oral syringe will be supplied. Parents should be advised not to add any medicines to the infant’s feed, since the drug may interact with the milk or other liquid in it; moreover the ingested dosage may be reduced if the child does not drink all the contents.

Parents must be warned to keep all medicines out of reach of children.

Rare paediatric conditions

Information on substances such as biotin and sodium benzoate used in rare metabolic conditions is included in BNF for Children; further information can be obtained from:

Many children’s doses are standardised by weight (and therefore require multiplying by the body-weight in kilograms to determine the child’s dose); occasionally, the doses have been standardised by body surface area (in m2). These methods should be used rather than attempting to calculate a child’s dose on the basis of doses used in adults.

For most drugs the adult maximum dose should not be exceeded. For example if the dose is stated as 8 mg/kg (max. 300 mg), a child weighing 10 kg should receive 80 mg but a child weighing 40 kg should receive 300 mg (rather than 320 mg).

Body surface area (BSA) estimates are sometimes preferable to body-weight for calculation of paediatric doses since many physiological phenomena correlate better with body surface area. Body surface area can be estimated from weight. For more information, refer to BNF for Children.

Where the dose for children is not stated, prescribers should consult BNF for Children or seek advice from a medicines information centre.

Dose frequency

Antibacterials are generally given at regular intervals throughout the day. Some flexibility should be allowed in children to avoid waking them during the night. For example, the night-time dose may be given at the child’s bedtime.

Where new or potentially toxic drugs are used, the manufacturers’ recommended doses should be carefully followed.

    <p>Drugs can have harmful effects on the embryo or fetus at any time during pregnancy. It is important to bear this in mind when prescribing for a woman of <i>childbearing age</i> or for men <i>trying</i> to <i>father</i> a child.</p>
    <p>During the <i>first trimester</i> drugs can produce congenital malformations (teratogenesis), and the period of greatest risk is from the third to the eleventh week of pregnancy.</p>
    <p>During the <i>second</i> and <i>third trimesters</i> drugs can affect the growth or functional development of the fetus, or they can have toxic effects on fetal tissues.</p>
    <p>Drugs given shortly before term or during labour can have adverse effects on labour or on the neonate after delivery.</p>
    <p>Not all the damaging effects of intrauterine exposure to drugs are obvious at birth, some may only manifest later in life. Such late-onset effects include malignancy, e.g. adenocarcinoma of the vagina after puberty in females exposed to diethylstilbestrol in the womb, and adverse effects on intellectual, social, and functional development.</p>
    <p>The BNF and <i>BNF for Children</i> identifies drugs which:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>may have harmful effects in pregnancy and indicates the trimester of risk</li>
      <li>are not known to be harmful in pregnancy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The information is based on human data, but information from <i>animal</i> studies has been included for some drugs when its omission might be misleading. Maternal drug doses may require adjustment during pregnancy due to changes in maternal physiology but this is beyond the scope of the <i>BNF</i> and <i>BNF for Children</i>.</p>
    <p>Where care is needed when prescribing in pregnancy, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF and <i>BNF for Children</i>.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Important</p>
      <p>Drugs should be prescribed in pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother is thought to be greater than the risk to the fetus, and all drugs should be avoided if possible during the first trimester. Drugs which have been extensively used in pregnancy and appear to be usually safe should be prescribed in preference to new or untried drugs; and the smallest effective dose should be used. Few drugs have been shown conclusively to be teratogenic in humans, but no drug is safe beyond all doubt in early pregnancy. Screening procedures are available when there is a known risk of certain defects.</p>
      <p>

Drugs can have harmful effects on the embryo or fetus at any time during pregnancy. It is important to bear this in mind when prescribing for a woman of childbearing age or for men trying to father a child.

During the first trimester drugs can produce congenital malformations (teratogenesis), and the period of greatest risk is from the third to the eleventh week of pregnancy.

During the second and third trimesters drugs can affect the growth or functional development of the fetus, or they can have toxic effects on fetal tissues.

Drugs given shortly before term or during labour can have adverse effects on labour or on the neonate after delivery.

Not all the damaging effects of intrauterine exposure to drugs are obvious at birth, some may only manifest later in life. Such late-onset effects include malignancy, e.g. adenocarcinoma of the vagina after puberty in females exposed to diethylstilbestrol in the womb, and adverse effects on intellectual, social, and functional development.

The BNF and BNF for Children identifies drugs which:

may have harmful effects in pregnancy and indicates the trimester of riskare not known to be harmful in pregnancyThe information is based on human data, but information from animal studies has been included for some drugs when its omission might be misleading. Maternal drug doses may require adjustment during pregnancy due to changes in maternal physiology but this is beyond the scope of the BNF and BNF for Children.

Where care is needed when prescribing in pregnancy, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF and BNF for Children.

Important

Drugs should be prescribed in pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother is thought to be greater than the risk to the fetus, and all drugs should be avoided if possible during the first trimester. Drugs which have been extensively used in pregnancy and appear to be usually safe should be prescribed in preference to new or untried drugs; and the smallest effective dose should be used. Few drugs have been shown conclusively to be teratogenic in humans, but no drug is safe beyond all doubt in early pregnancy. Screening procedures are available when there is a known risk of certain defects.

Absence of information does not imply safety. It should be noted that the BNF and BNF for Children provide independent advice and may not always agree with the product literature.

Information on drugs and pregnancy is also available from the UK Teratology Information Service.www.uktis.org.

  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Appropriate prescribing</p>
    <p>Elderly patients often receive multiple drugs for their multiple diseases. This greatly increases the risk of drug interactions as well as adverse reactions, and may affect compliance. The balance of benefit and harm of some medicines may be altered in the elderly. Therefore, elderly patients’ medicines should be reviewed regularly and medicines which are not of benefit should be stopped.</p>
    <p>Non-pharmacological measures may be more appropriate for symptoms such as headache, sleeplessness, and light-headedness when associated with social stress as in widowhood, loneliness, and family dispersal.</p>

  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Form of medicine</p>
    <p>Frail elderly patients may have difficulty swallowing tablets; if left in the mouth, ulceration may develop. They should always be encouraged to take their tablets or capsules with enough fluid, and whilst in an upright position to avoid the possibility of oesophageal ulceration. It can be helpful to discuss with the patient the possibility of taking the drug as a liquid if available.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Manifestations of ageing</p>
    <p>In the very old, manifestations of normal ageing may be mistaken for disease and lead to inappropriate prescribing. In addition, age-related muscle weakness and difficulty in maintaining balance should not be confused with neurological disease. Disorders such as light-headedness not associated with postural or postprandial hypotension are unlikely to be helped by drugs.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Sensitivity</p>
    <p>The nervous system of elderly patients is more sensitive to many commonly used drugs, such as opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and antiparkinsonian drugs, all of which must be used with caution. Similarly, other organs may also be more susceptible to the effects of drugs such as anti-hypertensives and NSAIDs.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Pharmacokinetics</p>
    <p>Pharmacokinetic changes can markedly increase the tissue concentration of a drug in the elderly, especially in debilitated patients.</p>
    <p>The most important effect of age is reduced renal clearance. Many aged patients thus <i>excrete drugs slowly</i>, and are <i>highly susceptible to nephrotoxic drugs</i>. Acute illness can lead to rapid reduction in renal clearance, especially if accompanied by dehydration. Hence, a patient stabilised on a drug with a narrow margin between the therapeutic and the toxic dose (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/digoxin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP752\">digoxin</xref>) can rapidly develop adverse effects in the aftermath of a myocardial infarction or a respiratory-tract infection. The hepatic metabolism of lipid soluble drugs is reduced in elderly patients because there is a reduction in liver volume. This is important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Adverse reactions</p>
    <p>Adverse reactions often present in the elderly in a vague and non-specific fashion. <i>Confusion</i> is often the presenting symptom (caused by almost any of the commonly used drugs). Other common manifestations are <i>constipation</i> (with antimuscarinics and many tranquillisers) and postural <i>hypotension</i> and <i>falls</i> (with diuretics and many psychotropics).</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypnotics</p>
    <p>Many hypnotics with long half-lives have serious hangover effects, including drowsiness, unsteady gait, slurred speech, and confusion. Hypnotics with short half-lives should be used but they too can present problems. Short courses of hypnotics are occasionally useful for helping a patient through an acute illness or some other crisis but every effort must be made to avoid dependence. Benzodiazepines impair balance, which can result in falls.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Diuretics</p>
    <p>Diuretics are overprescribed in old age and should <b>not</b> be used on a long-term basis to treat simple gravitational oedema which will usually respond to increased movement, raising the legs, and support stockings. A few days of diuretic treatment may speed the clearing of the oedema but it should rarely need continued drug therapy.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">NSAIDs</p>
    <p>Bleeding associated with aspirin and other NSAIDs is more common in the elderly who are more likely to have a fatal or serious outcome. NSAIDs are also a special hazard in patients with cardiac disease or renal impairment which may again place older patients at particular risk.</p>
    <p>Owing to the <i>increased susceptibility of the elderly</i> to the <i>side-effects of NSAIDs</i> the following recommendations are made:</p>

      <li>for pain relief when either drug is inadequate, paracetamol in a full dose plus a low-dose NSAID may be given;</li>
      <li>if necessary, the NSAID dose can be increased or an opioid analgesic given with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref>;</li>

Old people, especially the very old, require special care and consideration from prescribers.

However, elderly patients should not be denied medicines which may help them, such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs for atrial fibrillation, antihypertensives, statins, and drugs for osteoporosis.

They should always be encouraged to take their tablets or capsules with enough fluid, and whilst in an upright position to avoid the possibility of oesophageal ulceration. It can be helpful to discuss with the patient the possibility of taking the drug as a liquid if available.

NSAIDs

Bleeding associated with aspirin and other NSAIDs is more common in the elderly who are more likely to have a fatal or serious outcome. NSAIDs are also a special hazard in patients with cardiac disease or renal impairment which may again place older patients at particular risk.

Owing to the increased susceptibility of the elderly to the side-effects of NSAIDs the following recommendations are made:

for osteoarthritis, soft-tissue lesions, and back pain, first try measures such as weight reduction (if obese), warmth, exercise, and use of a walking stick;for osteoarthritis, soft-tissue lesions, back pain, and pain in rheumatoid arthritis, paracetamol should be used first and can often provide adequate pain relief;alternatively, a low-dose NSAID (e.g. ibuprofen up to 1.2 g daily) may be given;for pain relief when either drug is inadequate, paracetamol in a full dose plus a low-dose NSAID may be given;if necessary, the NSAID dose can be increased or an opioid analgesic given with paracetamol;do not give two NSAIDs at the same time.Prophylaxis of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers may be required if continued NSAID treatment is necessary see, NSAID-associated ulcers under Peptic ulceration.

Other drugs

Other drugs which commonly cause adverse reactions are antiparkinsonian drugs, antihypertensives, psychotropics, and digoxin. The usual maintenance dose of digoxin in very old patients is 125 micrograms daily (62.5 micrograms in those with renal disease); lower doses are often inadequate but toxicity is common in those given 250 micrograms daily.

Drug-induced blood disorders are much more common in the elderly. Therefore drugs with a tendency to cause bone marrow depression (e.g. co-trimoxazole, mianserin hydrochloride) should be avoided unless there is no acceptable alternative.

The elderly generally require a lower maintenance dose of warfarin sodium than younger adults; once again, the outcome of bleeding tends to be more serious.

Guidelines

Always consider whether a drug is indicated at all.

Limit range

It is a sensible policy to prescribe from a limited range of drugs and to be thoroughly familiar with their effects in the elderly.

Reduce dose

Dosage should generally be substantially lower than for younger patients and it is common to start with about 50% of the adult dose. Some drugs (e.g. long-acting antidiabetic drugs such as glibenclamide) should be avoided altogether.

Review regularly

Review repeat prescriptions regularly. In many patients it may be possible to stop some drugs, provided that clinical progress is monitored. It may be necessary to reduce the dose of some drugs as renal function declines.

Simplify regimens

Elderly patients benefit from simple treatment regimens. Only drugs with a clear indication should be prescribed and whenever possible given once or twice daily. In particular, regimens which call for a confusing array of dosage intervals should be avoided.

Explain clearly

Write full instructions on every prescription (including repeat prescriptions) so that containers can be properly labelled with full directions. Avoid imprecisions like ‘as directed’. Child-resistant containers may be unsuitable.

Repeats and disposal

Instruct patients what to do when drugs run out, and also how to dispose of any that are no longer necessary. Try to prescribe matching quantities.

If these guidelines are followed most elderly people will cope adequately with their own medicines. If not then it is essential to enrol the help of a third party, usually a relative or a friend.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Adrenal insufficiency</p>
    <p>Adrenal insufficiency may follow prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and can persist for years after stopping. A patient with adrenal insufficiency may become hypotensive under the stress of a dental visit (important: see individual monographs for details of corticosteroid cover before dental surgical procedures under general anaesthesia).</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lay the patient flat</li>

        <li>Transfer patient urgently to hospital</li>
      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Anaphylaxis</p>
    <p>A severe allergic reaction may follow oral or parenteral administration of a drug. Anaphylactic reactions in dentistry may follow the administration of a drug or contact with substances such as latex in surgical gloves. In general, the more rapid the onset of the reaction the more profound it tends to be. Symptoms may develop within minutes and rapid treatment is essential.</p>
    <p>Anaphylactic reactions may also be associated with <i>additives</i> and <i>excipients</i> in foods and medicines. Refined arachis (peanut) oil, which may be present in some medicinal products, is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction—nevertheless it is wise to check the full formula of preparations which may contain allergens (including those for topical application, particularly if they are intended for use in the mouth or for application to the nasal mucosa).</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Symptoms and signs</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paraesthesia, flushing, and swelling of face</li>
        <li>Generalised itching, especially of hands and feet</li>
        <li>Bronchospasm and laryngospasm (with wheezing and difficulty in breathing)</li>
        <li>Rapid weak pulse together with fall in blood pressure and pallor; finally cardiac arrest</li>
      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management</p>
      <p>First-line treatment includes securing the airway, restoration of blood pressure (laying the patient flat and raising the feet, or in the recovery position if unconscious or nauseous and at risk of vomiting), and administration of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref> injection. This is given <b>intramuscularly</b> in a dose of 500 micrograms (0.5 mL adrenaline injection 1 in 1000); a dose of 300 micrograms (0.3 mL adrenaline injection 1 in 1000) may be appropriate for immediate self-administration. The dose is repeated if necessary at 5-minute intervals according to blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory function. <b>Oxygen</b> administration is also of primary importance. Arrangements should be made to transfer the patient to hospital urgently.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Asthma</p>
    <p>Patients with asthma may have an attack while at the dental surgery. Most attacks will respond to 2 puffs of the patient’s short-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonist inhaler such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/salbutamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1756\">salbutamol</xref> 100 micrograms/puff; further puffs are required if the patient does not respond rapidly. If the patient is unable to use the inhaler effectively, further puffs should be given through a large-volume spacer device (or, if not available, through a plastic or paper cup with a hole in the bottom for the inhaler mouthpiece). If the response remains unsatisfactory, or if further deterioration occurs, then the patient should be transferred urgently to hospital. Whilst awaiting transfer, <b>oxygen</b> should be given with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/salbutamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1756\">salbutamol</xref> 5 mg or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/terbutaline-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1775\">terbutaline sulfate</xref> 10 mg by nebuliser; if a nebuliser is unavailable, then 2–10 puffs of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/salbutamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1756\">salbutamol</xref> 100 micrograms/metered inhalation should be given (preferably by a large-volume spacer), and repeated every 10–20 minutes if necessary. If asthma is part of a more generalised anaphylactic reaction, an intramuscular injection of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref> (as detailed under Anaphylaxis) should be given.</p>
    <p>Patients with severe chronic asthma or whose asthma has deteriorated previously during a dental procedure may require an increase in their prophylactic medication before a dental procedure. This should be discussed with the patient’s medical practitioner and may include increasing the dose of inhaled or oral corticosteroid.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Cardiac emergencies</p>
    <p>If there is a history of <i>angina</i> the patient will probably carry <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glyceryl-trinitrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP705\">glyceryl trinitrate</xref> spray or tablets (or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isosorbide-dinitrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1283\">isosorbide dinitrate</xref> tablets) and should be allowed to use them. Hospital admission is not necessary if symptoms are mild and resolve rapidly with the patient’s own medication. See also Coronary Artery Disease.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Arrhythmias</i> may lead to a sudden reduction in cardiac output with loss of consciousness. Medical assistance should be summoned. For advice on pacemaker interference, see also Pacemakers.</p>
    <p>The pain of <i>myocardial infarction</i> is similar to that of angina but generally more severe and more prolonged. For general advice see also Coronary Artery Disease.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Symptoms and signs of myocardial infarction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressive onset of severe, crushing pain across front of chest; pain may radiate towards the shoulder and down arm, or into neck and jaw</li>
        <li>Skin becomes pale and clammy</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting are common</li>
        <li>Pulse may be weak and blood pressure may fall</li>
        <li>Breathlessness</li>
      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Initial management of myocardial infarction:</p>
      <p>Call immediately for medical assistance and an ambulance, as appropriate.</p>
      <p>Allow the patient to rest in the position that feels most comfortable; in the presence of breathlessness this is likely to be sitting position, whereas the syncopal patient should be laid flat; often an intermediate position (dictated by the patient) will be most appropriate. <b>Oxygen</b> may be administered.</p>
      <p>Sublingual <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glyceryl-trinitrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP705\">glyceryl trinitrate</xref> may relieve pain. Intramuscular injection of drugs should be avoided because absorption may be too slow (particularly when cardiac output is reduced) and pain relief is inadequate. Intramuscular injection also increases the risk of local bleeding into the muscle if the patient is given a thrombolytic drug.</p>
      <p>Reassure the patient as much as possible to relieve further anxiety. If available, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> in a single dose of 300 mg should be given. A note (to say that aspirin has been given) should be sent with the patient to the hospital. For further details on the initial management of myocardial infarction, see Management of ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.</p>
      <p>If the patient collapses and loses consciousness attempt standard resuscitation measures. See also <b>algorithm</b> of the procedure for <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"treatment-summary/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation.xml\" type=\"bookmark\" rel=\"treatmentsummary\" bnfid=\"PHP78105\">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</xref>.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Epileptic seizures</p>
    <p>Patients with epilepsy must continue with their normal dosage of anticonvulsant drugs when attending for dental treatment. It is not uncommon for epileptic patients not to volunteer the information that they are epileptic but there should be little difficulty in recognising a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There may be a brief warning (but variable)</li>
      <li>Sudden loss of consciousness, the patient becomes rigid, falls, may give a cry, and becomes cyanotic (tonic phase)</li>
      <li>After 30 seconds, there are jerking movements of the limbs; the tongue may be bitten (clonic phase)</li>
      <li>There may be frothing from mouth and urinary incontinence</li>
      <li>The seizure typically lasts a few minutes; the patient may then become flaccid but remain unconscious. After a variable time the patient regains consciousness but may remain confused for a while</li>
    </ul>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management</p>
      <p>During a convulsion try to ensure that the patient is not at risk from injury but make no attempt to put anything in the mouth or between the teeth (in mistaken belief that this will protect the tongue). Give <b>oxygen</b> to support respiration if necessary.</p>
      <p>Do not attempt to restrain convulsive movements.</p>
      <p>After convulsive movements have subsided place the patient in the coma (recovery) position and check the airway.</p>
      <p>After the convulsion the patient may be confused (‘postictal confusion’) and may need reassurance and sympathy. The patient should not be sent home until fully recovered. Seek medical attention or transfer the patient to hospital if it was the first episode of epilepsy, or if the convulsion was atypical, prolonged (or repeated), or if injury occurred.</p>
      <p>Medication should only be given if convulsive seizures are prolonged (convulsive movements lasting 5 minutes or longer) or repeated rapidly.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/midazolam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3037\">Midazolam</xref> oromucosal solution can be given by the buccal route in adults as a single dose of 10 mg [unlicensed].

      <p>Focal seizures similarly need very little active management (in an automatism only a minimum amount of restraint should be applied to prevent injury). Again, the patient should be observed until post-ictal confusion has completely resolved.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypoglycaemia</p>
    <p>Insulin-treated diabetic patients attending for dental treatment under local anaesthesia should inject insulin and eat meals as normal. If food is omitted the blood glucose will fall to an abnormally low level (hypoglycaemia). Patients can often recognise the symptoms themselves and this state responds to sugar in water or a few lumps of sugar. Children may not have such prominent changes but may appear unduly lethargic.</p>

Approximately 10 g of glucose is available from non-diet versions of <i>Lucozade</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /><i>Energy Original</i> 55 mL, <i>Coca- Cola</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> 100 mL, <i>Ribena</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /><i>Blackcurrant</i> 19 mL (to be diluted), 2 teaspoons sugar, and also from 3 sugar lumps( Proprietary products of quick-acting carbohydrate (e.g. GlucoGel<tm tmtype=\"reg\" />, Dextrogel<tm tmtype=\"reg\" />, GSF-Syrup<tm tmtype=\"reg\" />, Rapilose<tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> gel) are available on prescription for the patient to keep to hand in case of hypoglycaemia). If necessary this may be repeated in 10–15 minutes.</p>
      <p>If glucose cannot be given by mouth, if it is ineffective, or if the hypoglycaemia causes unconsciousness, <b>glucagon</b> 1 mg (1 unit) should be given by intramuscular (or subcutaneous) injection; a child under 8 years or of body-weight under 25 kg should be given 500 micrograms. Once the patient regains consciousness oral glucose should be administered as above. If glucagon is ineffective or contra-indicated, the patient should be transferred urgently to hospital. The patient must also be admitted to hospital if hypoglycaemia is caused by an oral antidiabetic drug.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Syncope</p>
    <p>Insufficient blood supply to the brain results in loss of consciousness. The commonest cause is a vasovagal attack or simple faint (syncope) due to emotional stress.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Other possible causes</p>
      <p>Postural hypotension can be a consequence of rising abruptly or of standing upright for too long; antihypertensive drugs predispose to this. When rising, susceptible patients should take their time. Management is as for a vasovagal attack.</p>
      <p>Under stressful circumstances, some patients hyperventilate. This gives rise to feelings of faintness but does not usually result in syncope. In most cases reassurance is all that is necessary; rebreathing from cupped hands or a bag may be helpful but calls for careful supervision.</p>
      <p>Adrenal insufficiency or arrhythmias are other possible causes of syncope.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Medical problems in dental practice</p>
    <p>Individuals presenting at the dental surgery may also suffer from an unrelated medical condition; this may require modification to the management of their dental condition. If the patient has systemic disease or is taking other medication, the matter may need to be discussed with the patient’s general practitioner or hospital consultant.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Allergy</p>
      <p>Patients should be asked about any history of allergy; those with a history of atopic allergy (asthma, eczema, hay fever, etc.) are at special risk. Those with a history of a severe allergy or of anaphylactic reactions are at high risk—it is essential to confirm that they are not allergic to any medication, or to any dental materials or equipment (including latex gloves). See also Anaphylaxis.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Arrhythmias</p>
      <p>Patients, especially those who suffer from heart failure or who have sustained a myocardial infarction, may have irregular cardiac rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia even in patients with normal hearts and is of little concern except that dentists should be aware that such patients may be receiving anticoagulant therapy. The patient’s medical practitioner should be asked whether any special precautions are necessary. Premedication (e.g. with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/temazepam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2116\">temazepam</xref>) may be useful in some instances for very anxious patients.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Coronary artery disease</p>
      <p>Patients are vulnerable for at least 4 weeks following a myocardial infarction or following any sudden increase in the symptoms of angina. It would be advisable to check with the patient’s medical practitioner before commencing treatment. See also Cardiac Emergencies.</p>

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Cyanotic heart disease</p>
      <p>Patients with cyanotic heart disease are at risk in the dental chair, particularly if they have pulmonary hypertension. In such patients a syncopal reaction increases the shunt away from the lungs, causing more hypoxia which worsens the syncopal reaction—a vicious circle that may prove fatal. The advice of the cardiologist should be sought on any patient with congenital cyanotic heart disease. Treatment in hospital is more appropriate for some patients with this condition.</p>
    </sectiondiv>

      <p>Advice of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy is that patients who are immunosuppressed (including transplant patients) and patients with indwelling intraperitoneal catheters do not require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment provided there is no other indication for prophylaxis.</p>
      <p>The Working Party has commented that there is little evidence that dental treatment is followed by infection in immunosuppressed and immunodeficient patients nor is there evidence that dental treatment is followed by infection in patients with indwelling intraperitoneal catheters.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Infective endocarditis</p>
      <p>While almost any dental procedure can cause bacteraemia, there is no clear association with the development of infective endocarditis. Routine daily activities such as tooth brushing also produce a bacteraemia and may present a greater risk of infective endocarditis than a single dental procedure.</p>
      <p>Antibacterial prophylaxis and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlorhexidine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8126\">chlorhexidine</xref> mouthwash are <b>not</b> recommended for the prevention of endocarditis in patients undergoing dental procedures.

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Joint prostheses</p>
      <p>Advice of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy is that patients with prosthetic joint implants (including total hip replacements) do not require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment. The Working Party considers that it is unacceptable to expose patients to the adverse effects of antibiotics when there is no evidence that such prophylaxis is of any benefit, but that those who develop any intercurrent infection require prompt treatment with antibiotics to which the infecting organisms are sensitive.</p>
      <p>The Working Party has commented that joint infections have rarely been shown to follow dental procedures and are even more rarely caused by oral streptococci.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Pacemakers</p>
      <p>Pacemakers prevent asystole or severe bradycardia. Some ultrasonic scalers, electronic apex locators, electro-analgesic devices, and electrocautery devices interfere with the normal function of pacemakers (including shielded pacemakers) and should not be used. The manufacturer’s literature should be consulted whenever possible. If severe bradycardia occurs in a patient fitted with a pacemaker, electrical equipment should be switched off and the patient placed supine with the legs elevated. If the patient loses consciousness and the pulse remains slow or is absent, cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be needed. Call immediately for medical assistance and an ambulance, as appropriate.</p>
      <p>A Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy does not recommend antibacterial prophylaxis for patients with pacemakers.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Thromboembolic disease</p>
      <p>Patients receiving a <b>heparin</b> or an oral anticoagulant such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/warfarin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1494\">warfarin sodium</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/acenocoumarol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1499\">acenocoumarol</xref> (nicoumalone), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/phenindione.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1501\">phenindione</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/apixaban.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1508\">apixaban</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dabigatran-etexilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1505\">dabigatran etexilate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rivaroxaban.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1513\">rivaroxaban</xref> may be liable to excessive bleeding after extraction of teeth or other dental surgery. Often dental surgery can be delayed until the anticoagulant therapy has been completed.</p>
      <p>For a patient requiring long-term therapy with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/warfarin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1494\">warfarin sodium</xref>, the patient’s medical practitioner should be consulted and the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be assessed 72 hours before the dental procedure. This allows sufficient time for dose modification if necessary. In those with an unstable INR (including those who require weekly monitoring of their INR, or those who have had some INR measurements greater than 4.0 in the last 2 months), the INR should be assessed within 24 hours of the dental procedure. Patients requiring minor dental procedures (including extractions) who have an INR below 4.0 may continue <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/warfarin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1494\">warfarin sodium</xref> without dose adjustment. There is no need to check the INR for a patient requiring a non-invasive dental procedure.</p>
      <p>If it is necessary to remove several teeth, a single extraction should be done first; if this goes well further teeth may be extracted at subsequent visits (two or three at a time). Measures should be taken to minimise bleeding during and after the procedure. This includes the use of sutures and a haemostatic such as oxidised cellulose, collagen sponge or resorbable gelatin sponge. Scaling and root planing should initially be restricted to a limited area to assess the potential for bleeding.</p>
      <p>For a patient on long-term <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/warfarin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1494\">warfarin sodium</xref>, the advice of the clinician responsible for the patient’s anticoagulation should be sought if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the INR is unstable, or if the INR is greater than 4.0;</li>
        <li>the patient has thrombocytopenia, haemophilia, or other disorders of haemostasis, or suffers from liver impairment, alcoholism, or renal failure;</li>
        <li>the patient is receiving antiplatelet drugs, cytotoxic drugs or radiotherapy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Intramuscular injections are <i>contra-indicated</i> in patients taking anticoagulants with an INR above the therapeutic range, and in those with any disorder of haemostasis. In patients taking anticoagulants who have a stable INR within the therapeutic range, intramuscular injections should be avoided if possible; if an intramuscular injection is necessary, the patient should be informed of the increased risk of localised bleeding and monitored carefully.</p>
      <p>A local anaesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor should be given by infiltration, or by intraligamentary or mental nerve injection if possible. If regional nerve blocks cannot be avoided the local anaesthetic should be given cautiously using an aspirating syringe.</p>
      <p>Drugs which have potentially serious interactions with anticoagulants include aspirin and other NSAIDs, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/carbamazepine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2909\">carbamazepine</xref>, imidazole and triazole antifungals (including <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/miconazole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7386\">miconazole</xref>), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/erythromycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3510\">erythromycin</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clarithromycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3505\">clarithromycin</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metronidazole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3647\">metronidazole</xref>; for details of these and other interactions with anticoagulants, see Appendix 1 (dabigatran etexilate, heparins, phenindione, rivaroxaban, and coumarins).</p>
      <p>Although studies have failed to demonstrate an interaction, common experience in anticoagulant clinics is that the INR can be altered following a course of an oral broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ampicillin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3330\">ampicillin</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amoxicillin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3327\">amoxicillin</xref>.</p>

Medical emergencies in dental practice

This section provides guidelines on the management of the more common medical emergencies which may arise in dental practice. Dentists and their staff should be familiar with standard resuscitation procedures, but in all circumstances it is advisable to summon medical assistance as soon as possible. See also algorithm of the procedure for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

The drugs referred to in this section include:

Adrenaline/epinephrine Injection, adrenaline 1 in 1000, (adrenaline 1 mg/mL as acid tartrate), 1 mL ampsAspirin Dispersible Tablets 300 mgGlucagon Injection, glucagon (as hydrochloride), 1- unit vial (with solvent)Glucose (for administration by mouth)Glyceryl trinitrate SprayMidazolam Oromucosal Solution, midazolam 5 mg/mLOxygenSalbutamol Aerosol Inhalation, salbutamol 100 micrograms/ metered inhalationAdrenal insufficiency

Adrenal insufficiency may follow prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and can persist for years after stopping. A patient with adrenal insufficiency may become hypotensive under the stress of a dental visit (important: see individual monographs for details of corticosteroid cover before dental surgical procedures under general anaesthesia).

Management

Lay the patient flatGive oxygenTransfer patient urgently to hospitalAnaphylaxis

A severe allergic reaction may follow oral or parenteral administration of a drug. Anaphylactic reactions in dentistry may follow the administration of a drug or contact with substances such as latex in surgical gloves. In general, the more rapid the onset of the reaction the more profound it tends to be. Symptoms may develop within minutes and rapid treatment is essential.

Anaphylactic reactions may also be associated with additives and excipients in foods and medicines. Refined arachis (peanut) oil, which may be present in some medicinal products, is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction—nevertheless it is wise to check the full formula of preparations which may contain allergens (including those for topical application, particularly if they are intended for use in the mouth or for application to the nasal mucosa).

Symptoms and signs

Paraesthesia, flushing, and swelling of faceGeneralised itching, especially of hands and feetBronchospasm and laryngospasm (with wheezing and difficulty in breathing)Rapid weak pulse together with fall in blood pressure and pallor; finally cardiac arrestManagement

First-line treatment includes securing the airway, restoration of blood pressure (laying the patient flat and raising the feet, or in the recovery position if unconscious or nauseous and at risk of vomiting), and administration of adrenaline/epinephrine injection. This is given intramuscularly in a dose of 500 micrograms (0.5 mL adrenaline injection 1 in 1000); a dose of 300 micrograms (0.3 mL adrenaline injection 1 in 1000) may be appropriate for immediate self-administration. The dose is repeated if necessary at 5-minute intervals according to blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory function. Oxygen administration is also of primary importance. Arrangements should be made to transfer the patient to hospital urgently.

Asthma

Patients with asthma may have an attack while at the dental surgery. Most attacks will respond to 2 puffs of the patient’s short-acting beta2 agonist inhaler such as salbutamol 100 micrograms/puff; further puffs are required if the patient does not respond rapidly. If the patient is unable to use the inhaler effectively, further puffs should be given through a large-volume spacer device (or, if not available, through a plastic or paper cup with a hole in the bottom for the inhaler mouthpiece). If the response remains unsatisfactory, or if further deterioration occurs, then the patient should be transferred urgently to hospital. Whilst awaiting transfer, oxygen should be given with salbutamol 5 mg or terbutaline sulfate 10 mg by nebuliser; if a nebuliser is unavailable, then 2–10 puffs of salbutamol 100 micrograms/metered inhalation should be given (preferably by a large-volume spacer), and repeated every 10–20 minutes if necessary. If asthma is part of a more generalised anaphylactic reaction, an intramuscular injection of adrenaline/epinephrine (as detailed under Anaphylaxis) should be given.

Patients with severe chronic asthma or whose asthma has deteriorated previously during a dental procedure may require an increase in their prophylactic medication before a dental procedure. This should be discussed with the patient’s medical practitioner and may include increasing the dose of inhaled or oral corticosteroid.

Cardiac emergencies

If there is a history of angina the patient will probably carry glyceryl trinitrate spray or tablets (or isosorbide dinitrate tablets) and should be allowed to use them. Hospital admission is not necessary if symptoms are mild and resolve rapidly with the patient’s own medication. See also Coronary Artery Disease.

Arrhythmias may lead to a sudden reduction in cardiac output with loss of consciousness. Medical assistance should be summoned. For advice on pacemaker interference, see also Pacemakers.

The pain of myocardial infarction is similar to that of angina but generally more severe and more prolonged. For general advice see also Coronary Artery Disease.

Symptoms and signs of myocardial infarction:

Progressive onset of severe, crushing pain across front of chest; pain may radiate towards the shoulder and down arm, or into neck and jawSkin becomes pale and clammyNausea and vomiting are commonPulse may be weak and blood pressure may fallBreathlessnessInitial management of myocardial infarction:

Call immediately for medical assistance and an ambulance, as appropriate.

Allow the patient to rest in the position that feels most comfortable; in the presence of breathlessness this is likely to be sitting position, whereas the syncopal patient should be laid flat; often an intermediate position (dictated by the patient) will be most appropriate. Oxygen may be administered.

Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate may relieve pain. Intramuscular injection of drugs should be avoided because absorption may be too slow (particularly when cardiac output is reduced) and pain relief is inadequate. Intramuscular injection also increases the risk of local bleeding into the muscle if the patient is given a thrombolytic drug.

Reassure the patient as much as possible to relieve further anxiety. If available, aspirin in a single dose of 300 mg should be given. A note (to say that aspirin has been given) should be sent with the patient to the hospital. For further details on the initial management of myocardial infarction, see Management of ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.

If the patient collapses and loses consciousness attempt standard resuscitation measures. See also algorithm of the procedure for Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Epileptic seizures

Patients with epilepsy must continue with their normal dosage of anticonvulsant drugs when attending for dental treatment. It is not uncommon for epileptic patients not to volunteer the information that they are epileptic but there should be little difficulty in recognising a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure.

There may be a brief warning (but variable)Sudden loss of consciousness, the patient becomes rigid, falls, may give a cry, and becomes cyanotic (tonic phase)After 30 seconds, there are jerking movements of the limbs; the tongue may be bitten (clonic phase)There may be frothing from mouth and urinary incontinenceThe seizure typically lasts a few minutes; the patient may then become flaccid but remain unconscious. After a variable time the patient regains consciousness but may remain confused for a whileManagement

During a convulsion try to ensure that the patient is not at risk from injury but make no attempt to put anything in the mouth or between the teeth (in mistaken belief that this will protect the tongue). Give oxygen to support respiration if necessary.

Do not attempt to restrain convulsive movements.

After convulsive movements have subsided place the patient in the coma (recovery) position and check the airway.

After the convulsion the patient may be confused (‘postictal confusion’) and may need reassurance and sympathy. The patient should not be sent home until fully recovered. Seek medical attention or transfer the patient to hospital if it was the first episode of epilepsy, or if the convulsion was atypical, prolonged (or repeated), or if injury occurred.

Medication should only be given if convulsive seizures are prolonged (convulsive movements lasting 5 minutes or longer) or repeated rapidly.

Midazolam oromucosal solution can be given by the buccal route in adults as a single dose of 10 mg [unlicensed]. For further details on the management of status epilepticus, including details of paediatric doses of midazolam, see Drugs used in status epilepticus (Epilepsy).

Focal seizures similarly need very little active management (in an automatism only a minimum amount of restraint should be applied to prevent injury). Again, the patient should be observed until post-ictal confusion has completely resolved.

Hypoglycaemia

Insulin-treated diabetic patients attending for dental treatment under local anaesthesia should inject insulin and eat meals as normal. If food is omitted the blood glucose will fall to an abnormally low level (hypoglycaemia). Patients can often recognise the symptoms themselves and this state responds to sugar in water or a few lumps of sugar. Children may not have such prominent changes but may appear unduly lethargic.

Symptoms and signs

Shaking and tremblingSweating‘Pins and needles’ in lips and tongueHungerPalpitationHeadache (occasionally)Double visionDifficulty in concentrationSlurring of speechConfusionChange of behaviour; truculenceConvulsionsUnconsciousnessManagement

Initially glucose 10–20 g is given by mouth either in liquid form or as granulated sugar or sugar lumps. Approximately 10 g of glucose is available from non-diet versions of LucozadeEnergy Original 55 mL, Coca- Cola 100 mL, RibenaBlackcurrant 19 mL (to be diluted), 2 teaspoons sugar, and also from 3 sugar lumps( Proprietary products of quick-acting carbohydrate (e.g. GlucoGel, Dextrogel, GSF-Syrup, Rapilose gel) are available on prescription for the patient to keep to hand in case of hypoglycaemia). If necessary this may be repeated in 10–15 minutes.

If glucose cannot be given by mouth, if it is ineffective, or if the hypoglycaemia causes unconsciousness, glucagon 1 mg (1 unit) should be given by intramuscular (or subcutaneous) injection; a child under 8 years or of body-weight under 25 kg should be given 500 micrograms. Once the patient regains consciousness oral glucose should be administered as above. If glucagon is ineffective or contra-indicated, the patient should be transferred urgently to hospital. The patient must also be admitted to hospital if hypoglycaemia is caused by an oral antidiabetic drug.

Syncope

Insufficient blood supply to the brain results in loss of consciousness. The commonest cause is a vasovagal attack or simple faint (syncope) due to emotional stress.

Symptoms and signs

Patient feels faintLow blood pressurePallor and sweatingYawning and slow pulseNausea and vomitingDilated pupilsMuscular twitchingManagement

Lay the patient as flat as is reasonably comfortable and, in the absence of associated breathlessness, raise the legs to improve cerebral circulationLoosen any tight clothing around the neckOnce consciousness is regained, give sugar in water or a cup of sweet teaOther possible causes

Postural hypotension can be a consequence of rising abruptly or of standing upright for too long; antihypertensive drugs predispose to this. When rising, susceptible patients should take their time. Management is as for a vasovagal attack.

Under stressful circumstances, some patients hyperventilate. This gives rise to feelings of faintness but does not usually result in syncope. In most cases reassurance is all that is necessary; rebreathing from cupped hands or a bag may be helpful but calls for careful supervision.

Adrenal insufficiency or arrhythmias are other possible causes of syncope.

Medical problems in dental practice

Individuals presenting at the dental surgery may also suffer from an unrelated medical condition; this may require modification to the management of their dental condition. If the patient has systemic disease or is taking other medication, the matter may need to be discussed with the patient’s general practitioner or hospital consultant.

Allergy

Patients should be asked about any history of allergy; those with a history of atopic allergy (asthma, eczema, hay fever, etc.) are at special risk. Those with a history of a severe allergy or of anaphylactic reactions are at high risk—it is essential to confirm that they are not allergic to any medication, or to any dental materials or equipment (including latex gloves). See also Anaphylaxis.

Arrhythmias

Patients, especially those who suffer from heart failure or who have sustained a myocardial infarction, may have irregular cardiac rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia even in patients with normal hearts and is of little concern except that dentists should be aware that such patients may be receiving anticoagulant therapy. The patient’s medical practitioner should be asked whether any special precautions are necessary. Premedication (e.g. with temazepam) may be useful in some instances for very anxious patients.

See also Cardiac emergencies and Dental Anaesthesia (Local anaesthesia).

Cardiac prostheses

For an account of the risk of infective endocarditis in patients with prosthetic heart valves, see Infective Endocarditis. For advice on patients receiving anticoagulants, see Thromboembolic disease.

Coronary artery disease

Patients are vulnerable for at least 4 weeks following a myocardial infarction or following any sudden increase in the symptoms of angina. It would be advisable to check with the patient’s medical practitioner before commencing treatment. See also Cardiac Emergencies.

Treatment with low-dose aspirin (75 mg daily), clopidogrel, or dipyridamole should not be stopped routinely nor should the dose be altered before dental procedures.

A Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy has not recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for patients following coronary artery bypass surgery.

Cyanotic heart disease

Patients with cyanotic heart disease are at risk in the dental chair, particularly if they have pulmonary hypertension. In such patients a syncopal reaction increases the shunt away from the lungs, causing more hypoxia which worsens the syncopal reaction—a vicious circle that may prove fatal. The advice of the cardiologist should be sought on any patient with congenital cyanotic heart disease. Treatment in hospital is more appropriate for some patients with this condition.

Hypertension

Patients with hypertension are likely to be receiving antihypertensive drugs. Their blood pressure may fall dangerously low under general anaesthesia, see also under Dental Anaesthesia (Local anaesthesia).

Immunosuppression and indwelling intraperitoneal catheters

Advice of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy is that patients who are immunosuppressed (including transplant patients) and patients with indwelling intraperitoneal catheters do not require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment provided there is no other indication for prophylaxis.

The Working Party has commented that there is little evidence that dental treatment is followed by infection in immunosuppressed and immunodeficient patients nor is there evidence that dental treatment is followed by infection in patients with indwelling intraperitoneal catheters.

Infective endocarditis

While almost any dental procedure can cause bacteraemia, there is no clear association with the development of infective endocarditis. Routine daily activities such as tooth brushing also produce a bacteraemia and may present a greater risk of infective endocarditis than a single dental procedure.

Antibacterial prophylaxis and chlorhexidine mouthwash are not recommended for the prevention of endocarditis in patients undergoing dental procedures. Such prophylaxis may expose patients to the adverse effects of antimicrobials when the evidence of benefit has not been proven.

Reduction of oral bacteraemia

Patients at risk of endocarditis include those with valve replacement, acquired valvular heart disease with stenosis or regurgitation, structural congenital heart disease (including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect, fully repaired patent ductus arteriosus, and closure devices considered to be endothelialised), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or a previous episode of infective endocarditis, should be advised to maintain the highest possible standards of oral hygiene in order to reduce the:

need for dental extractions or other surgery;chances of severe bacteraemia if dental surgery is needed;possibility of ‘spontaneous’ bacteraemia.Postoperative care

Patients at risk of endocarditis include those with valve replacement, acquired valvular heart disease with stenosis or regurgitation, structural congenital heart disease (including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect, fully repaired patent ductus arteriosus, and closure devices considered to be endothelialised), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or a previous episode of infective endocarditis, should be warned to report to the doctor or dentist any unexplained illness that develops after dental treatment. 

Any infection in patients at risk of endocarditis should be investigated promptly and treated appropriately to reduce the risk of endocarditis.

Patients on anticoagulant therapy

For general advice on dental surgery in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy see Thromboembolic Disease.

Joint prostheses

Advice of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy is that patients with prosthetic joint implants (including total hip replacements) do not require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment. The Working Party considers that it is unacceptable to expose patients to the adverse effects of antibiotics when there is no evidence that such prophylaxis is of any benefit, but that those who develop any intercurrent infection require prompt treatment with antibiotics to which the infecting organisms are sensitive.

The Working Party has commented that joint infections have rarely been shown to follow dental procedures and are even more rarely caused by oral streptococci.

Pacemakers

Pacemakers prevent asystole or severe bradycardia. Some ultrasonic scalers, electronic apex locators, electro-analgesic devices, and electrocautery devices interfere with the normal function of pacemakers (including shielded pacemakers) and should not be used. The manufacturer’s literature should be consulted whenever possible. If severe bradycardia occurs in a patient fitted with a pacemaker, electrical equipment should be switched off and the patient placed supine with the legs elevated. If the patient loses consciousness and the pulse remains slow or is absent, cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be needed. Call immediately for medical assistance and an ambulance, as appropriate.

A Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy does not recommend antibacterial prophylaxis for patients with pacemakers.

Thromboembolic disease

Patients receiving a heparin or an oral anticoagulant such as warfarin sodium, acenocoumarol (nicoumalone), phenindione, apixaban, dabigatran etexilate or rivaroxaban may be liable to excessive bleeding after extraction of teeth or other dental surgery. Often dental surgery can be delayed until the anticoagulant therapy has been completed.

For a patient requiring long-term therapy with warfarin sodium, the patient’s medical practitioner should be consulted and the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be assessed 72 hours before the dental procedure. This allows sufficient time for dose modification if necessary. In those with an unstable INR (including those who require weekly monitoring of their INR, or those who have had some INR measurements greater than 4.0 in the last 2 months), the INR should be assessed within 24 hours of the dental procedure. Patients requiring minor dental procedures (including extractions) who have an INR below 4.0 may continue warfarin sodium without dose adjustment. There is no need to check the INR for a patient requiring a non-invasive dental procedure.

If it is necessary to remove several teeth, a single extraction should be done first; if this goes well further teeth may be extracted at subsequent visits (two or three at a time). Measures should be taken to minimise bleeding during and after the procedure. This includes the use of sutures and a haemostatic such as oxidised cellulose, collagen sponge or resorbable gelatin sponge. Scaling and root planing should initially be restricted to a limited area to assess the potential for bleeding.

For a patient on long-term warfarin sodium, the advice of the clinician responsible for the patient’s anticoagulation should be sought if:

the INR is unstable, or if the INR is greater than 4.0;the patient has thrombocytopenia, haemophilia, or other disorders of haemostasis, or suffers from liver impairment, alcoholism, or renal failure;the patient is receiving antiplatelet drugs, cytotoxic drugs or radiotherapy.Intramuscular injections are contra-indicated in patients taking anticoagulants with an INR above the therapeutic range, and in those with any disorder of haemostasis. In patients taking anticoagulants who have a stable INR within the therapeutic range, intramuscular injections should be avoided if possible; if an intramuscular injection is necessary, the patient should be informed of the increased risk of localised bleeding and monitored carefully.

A local anaesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor should be given by infiltration, or by intraligamentary or mental nerve injection if possible. If regional nerve blocks cannot be avoided the local anaesthetic should be given cautiously using an aspirating syringe.

Drugs which have potentially serious interactions with anticoagulants include aspirin and other NSAIDs, carbamazepine, imidazole and triazole antifungals (including miconazole), erythromycin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole; for details of these and other interactions with anticoagulants, see Appendix 1 (dabigatran etexilate, heparins, phenindione, rivaroxaban, and coumarins).

Although studies have failed to demonstrate an interaction, common experience in anticoagulant clinics is that the INR can be altered following a course of an oral broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin.

Information on the treatment of patients who take anticoagulants is available at www.npsa.nhs.uk/patientsafety/alerts-and-directives/alerts/anticoagulant.

Liver disease

Liver disease may alter the response to drugs and drug prescribing should be kept to a minimum in patients with severe liver disease. Problems are likely mainly in patients with jaundice, ascites, or evidence of encephalopathy.

For guidance on prescribing for patients with hepatic impairment, see Prescribing in hepatic impairment. Where care is needed when prescribing in hepatic impairment, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF.

Renal impairment

The use of drugs in patients with reduced renal function can give rise to many problems. Many of these problems can be avoided by reducing the dose or by using alternative drugs.

Special care is required in renal transplantation and immunosuppressed patients; if necessary such patients should be referred to specialists.

For guidance on prescribing in patients with renal impairment, see Prescribing in renal impairment. Where care is needed when prescribing in renal impairment, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF.

Pregnancy

Drugs taken during pregnancy can be harmful to the fetus and should be prescribed only if the expected benefit to the mother is thought to be greater than the risk to the fetus; all drugs should be avoided if possible during the first trimester.

For guidance on prescribing in pregnancy, see Prescribing in pregnancy. Where care is needed when prescribing in pregnancy, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF.

Breast-feeding

Some drugs taken by the mother whilst breast-feeding can be transferred to the breast milk, and may affect the infant.

For guidance on prescribing in breast-feeding, see Prescribing in breast-feeding. Where care is needed when prescribing in breast-feeding, this is indicated under the relevant drug in the BNF.
