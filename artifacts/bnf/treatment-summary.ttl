    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of conditions which include unstable angina, and myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation. Patients with different acute coronary syndromes may present similarly; definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, ECG changes, and measurement of biochemical cardiac markers.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)</p>
    <p>These are related acute coronary syndromes that fall between the classifications of stable angina and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). They usually occur as a result of atheromatous plaque rupture, and are often characterised by stable angina that suddenly worsens, recurring or prolonged angina at rest, or new onset of severe angina. Patients with unstable angina have no evidence of myocardial necrosis, whereas in NSTEMI, myocardial necrosis (less significant than with STEMI) will be evident. There is a risk of progression to STEMI or sudden death, particularly in patients who experience pain at rest.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management of unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)</p>
      <p>These conditions are managed similarly; the aims of management are to provide supportive care and pain relief during the acute attack and to prevent further cardiac events and death. For advice on the management of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), see below.</p>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Initial management</p>
        <p>
          <b>Oxygen</b> should be administered if there is evidence of hypoxia, pulmonary oedema, or continuing myocardial ischaemia; hyperoxia should be avoided and particular care is required in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Nitrates</b> are used to relieve ischaemic pain. If sublingual <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glyceryl-trinitrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP705\">glyceryl trinitrate</xref> is not effective, intravenous or buccal <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glyceryl-trinitrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP705\">glyceryl trinitrate</xref> or intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isosorbide-dinitrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1283\">isosorbide dinitrate</xref> is given. If pain continues, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2699\">diamorphine hydrochloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> can be given by slow intravenous injection; an antiemetic such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoclopramide-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2547\">metoclopramide hydrochloride</xref> should also be given.</p>
        <p>
          <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">Aspirin</xref> (chewed or dispersed in water) is given for its antiplatelet effect. If <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> is given before arrival at hospital, a note saying that it has been given should be sent with the patient. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">Clopidogrel</xref> should also be given. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/prasugrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1552\">Prasugrel</xref> is an alternative to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">clopidogrel</xref> in certain patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (see NICE guidance). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ticagrelor.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1554\">Ticagrelor</xref> is also an alternative to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">clopidogrel</xref> (see NICE guidance). Patients should also receive either <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref>, a <b>low molecular weight heparin</b>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fondaparinux-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1482\">fondaparinux sodium</xref>.</p>
        <p>Patients without contra-indications should receive <b>beta-blockers</b> which should be continued indefinitely. In patients without left ventricular dysfunction and in whom beta-blockers are inappropriate, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diltiazem-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1320\">diltiazem hydrochloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/verapamil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1372\">verapamil hydrochloride</xref> can be given.</p>
        <p>The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/eptifibatide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1550\">eptifibatide</xref> (in combination with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>) and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tirofiban.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1557\">tirofiban</xref> (in combination with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">clopidogrel</xref>) can be used for unstable angina or for NSTEMI in patients at a high risk of either myocardial infarction or death.</p>
        <p>In intermediate- and high-risk patients, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/abciximab.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1529\">abciximab</xref>or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/eptifibatide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1550\">eptifibatide</xref> (in combination with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>), or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tirofiban.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1557\">tirofiban</xref> (in combination with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">clopidogrel</xref>) can also be used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, to reduce the immediate risk of vascular occlusion. In intermediate- and high-risk patients in whom early intervention is planned, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bivalirudin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1471\">bivalirudin</xref> can be considered as an alternative to the combination of a glyocprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus a heparin.</p>
        <p>Revascularisation procedures are often appropriate for patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI; the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing coronary stenting.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Long-term management</p>
        <p>The need for long-term angina treatment or for coronary angiography should be assessed. Most patients will require standard angina treatment to prevent recurrence of symptoms.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)</p>
    <p>This is an acute coronary syndrome where atheromatous plaque rupture leads to thrombosis and myocardial ischaemia, with irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle, often leading to long-term complications. STEMI can also occasionally occur as a result of coronary spasm or embolism, arteritis, spontaneous thrombosis, or sudden severe elevation in blood pressure.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)</p>
      <p>These notes give an overview of the initial and long-term management of myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI). For advice on the management of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina, see above. The aims of management of STEMI are to provide supportive care and pain relief, to promote reperfusion and to reduce mortality. Oxygen, nitrates, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2699\">diamorphine hydrochloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref> can provide initial support and pain relief; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> and percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolytics promote reperfusion; anticoagulants help to reduce re-occlusion and systemic embolisation; long-term use of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins help to reduce mortality further.</p>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p>Local guidelines for the management of myocardial infarction should be followed where they exist.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Initial management</p>
        <p>
          <b>Oxygen</b> should be administered if there is evidence of hypoxia, pulmonary oedema, or continuing myocardial ischaemia; hyperoxia should be avoided and particular care is required in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease.</p>
        <p>The pain (and anxiety) of myocardial infarction is managed with slow intravenous injection of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diamorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2699\">diamorphine hydrochloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/morphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2740\">morphine</xref>; an antiemetic such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoclopramide-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2547\">metoclopramide hydrochloride</xref> (or, if left ventricular function is not compromised, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cyclizine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2522\">cyclizine</xref>) by intravenous injection should also be given.</p>
        <p>
          <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">Aspirin</xref> (chewed or dispersed in water) is given for its antiplatelet effect. If <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> is given before arrival at hospital, a note saying that it has been given should be sent with the patient. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">Clopidogrel</xref>, should also be given. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/prasugrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1552\">Prasugrel</xref>, is an alternative to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">clopidogrel</xref> in certain patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (see NICE guidance). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ticagrelor.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1554\">Ticagrelor</xref>, is also an alternative to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clopidogrel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1537\">clopidogrel</xref> (see NICE guidance).</p>
        <p>Patency of the occluded artery can be restored by percutaneous coronary intervention or by giving a <b>thrombolytic drug</b>, unless contra-indicated. Percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred method; a <b>glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor</b> can be used to reduce the risk of immediate vascular occlusion in intermediate- and high-risk patients. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention should also receive either <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref> or a low molecular weight heparin (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/enoxaparin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1460\">enoxaparin sodium</xref>); <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bivalirudin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1471\">bivalirudin</xref> is an alternative to the combination of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus a heparin (see also NICE guidance). In patients who cannot be offered percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes of diagnosis, a thrombolytic drug should be administered along with either <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref> (for maximum 2 days), a low molecular weight heparin (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/enoxaparin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1460\">enoxaparin sodium</xref>), or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fondaparinux-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1482\">fondaparinux sodium</xref>.

        <p>Patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy (with percutaneous coronary intervention or a thrombolytic) should be treated with either <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fondaparinux-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1482\">fondaparinux sodium</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/enoxaparin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1460\">enoxaparin sodium</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/heparin-unfractionated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1447\">heparin (unfractionated)</xref>. Prescribers should consult product literature and local protocols (where they exist) for details of anticoagulant dose and duration.</p>

        <p>Early administration of some <b>beta-blockers</b> has been shown to be of benefit and should be given to patients without contra-indications.</p>
        <p>
          <b>ACE inhibitors</b>, and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists if an ACE inhibitor cannot be used, are also of benefit to patients who have no contra-indications; in hypertensive and normotensive patients treatment with an ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, can be started within 24 hours of the myocardial infarction and continued for at least 5–6 weeks (see below for long-term treatment).</p>
        <p>All patients should be closely monitored for hyperglycaemia; those with diabetes or raised blood-glucose concentration should receive <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4049\">insulin</xref>.</p>

Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of conditions which include unstable angina, and myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation. Patients with different acute coronary syndromes may present similarly; definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, ECG changes, and measurement of biochemical cardiac markers.

Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)

These are related acute coronary syndromes that fall between the classifications of stable angina and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). They usually occur as a result of atheromatous plaque rupture, and are often characterised by stable angina that suddenly worsens, recurring or prolonged angina at rest, or new onset of severe angina. Patients with unstable angina have no evidence of myocardial necrosis, whereas in NSTEMI, myocardial necrosis (less significant than with STEMI) will be evident. There is a risk of progression to STEMI or sudden death, particularly in patients who experience pain at rest.

Management of unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)

These conditions are managed similarly; the aims of management are to provide supportive care and pain relief during the acute attack and to prevent further cardiac events and death. For advice on the management of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), see below.

Initial management

Oxygen should be administered if there is evidence of hypoxia, pulmonary oedema, or continuing myocardial ischaemia; hyperoxia should be avoided and particular care is required in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease.

Nitrates are used to relieve ischaemic pain. If sublingual glyceryl trinitrate is not effective, intravenous or buccal glyceryl trinitrate or intravenous isosorbide dinitrate is given. If pain continues, diamorphine hydrochloride or morphine can be given by slow intravenous injection; an antiemetic such as metoclopramide hydrochloride should also be given.

Aspirin (chewed or dispersed in water) is given for its antiplatelet effect. If aspirin is given before arrival at hospital, a note saying that it has been given should be sent with the patient. Clopidogrel should also be given. Prasugrel is an alternative to clopidogrel in certain patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (see NICE guidance). Ticagrelor is also an alternative to clopidogrel (see NICE guidance). Patients should also receive either heparin (unfractionated), a low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux sodium.

Patients without contra-indications should receive beta-blockers which should be continued indefinitely. In patients without left ventricular dysfunction and in whom beta-blockers are inappropriate, diltiazem hydrochloride or verapamil hydrochloride can be given.

The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors eptifibatide (in combination with heparin (unfractionated) and aspirin) and tirofiban (in combination with heparin (unfractionated), aspirin, and clopidogrel) can be used for unstable angina or for NSTEMI in patients at a high risk of either myocardial infarction or death.

In intermediate- and high-risk patients, abciximabor eptifibatide (in combination with heparin (unfractionated) and aspirin), or tirofiban (in combination with heparin (unfractionated), aspirin, and clopidogrel) can also be used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, to reduce the immediate risk of vascular occlusion. In intermediate- and high-risk patients in whom early intervention is planned, bivalirudin can be considered as an alternative to the combination of a glyocprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus a heparin.

Revascularisation procedures are often appropriate for patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI; the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing coronary stenting.

Long-term management

The need for long-term angina treatment or for coronary angiography should be assessed. Most patients will require standard angina treatment to prevent recurrence of symptoms.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

This is an acute coronary syndrome where atheromatous plaque rupture leads to thrombosis and myocardial ischaemia, with irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle, often leading to long-term complications. STEMI can also occasionally occur as a result of coronary spasm or embolism, arteritis, spontaneous thrombosis, or sudden severe elevation in blood pressure.

Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

These notes give an overview of the initial and long-term management of myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI). For advice on the management of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina, see above. The aims of management of STEMI are to provide supportive care and pain relief, to promote reperfusion and to reduce mortality. Oxygen, nitrates, and diamorphine hydrochloride or morphine can provide initial support and pain relief; aspirin and percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolytics promote reperfusion; anticoagulants help to reduce re-occlusion and systemic embolisation; long-term use of aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins help to reduce mortality further.

Local guidelines for the management of myocardial infarction should be followed where they exist.

Initial management

Oxygen should be administered if there is evidence of hypoxia, pulmonary oedema, or continuing myocardial ischaemia; hyperoxia should be avoided and particular care is required in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease.

The pain (and anxiety) of myocardial infarction is managed with slow intravenous injection of diamorphine hydrochloride or morphine; an antiemetic such as metoclopramide hydrochloride (or, if left ventricular function is not compromised, cyclizine) by intravenous injection should also be given.

Aspirin (chewed or dispersed in water) is given for its antiplatelet effect. If aspirin is given before arrival at hospital, a note saying that it has been given should be sent with the patient. Clopidogrel, should also be given. Prasugrel, is an alternative to clopidogrel in certain patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (see NICE guidance). Ticagrelor, is also an alternative to clopidogrel (see NICE guidance).

Patency of the occluded artery can be restored by percutaneous coronary intervention or by giving a thrombolytic drug, unless contra-indicated. Percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred method; a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor can be used to reduce the risk of immediate vascular occlusion in intermediate- and high-risk patients. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention should also receive either heparin (unfractionated) or a low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin sodium); bivalirudin is an alternative to the combination of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus a heparin (see also NICE guidance). In patients who cannot be offered percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes of diagnosis, a thrombolytic drug should be administered along with either heparin (unfractionated) (for maximum 2 days), a low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin sodium), or fondaparinux sodium. See use of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing coronary stenting in Antiplatelet drugs.

Patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy (with percutaneous coronary intervention or a thrombolytic) should be treated with either fondaparinux sodium, enoxaparin sodium, or heparin (unfractionated). Prescribers should consult product literature and local protocols (where they exist) for details of anticoagulant dose and duration.

Nitrates are used to relieve ischaemic pain. If sublingual glyceryl trinitrate is not effective, intravenous glyceryl trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate is given.

Early administration of some beta-blockers has been shown to be of benefit and should be given to patients without contra-indications.

ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists if an ACE inhibitor cannot be used, are also of benefit to patients who have no contra-indications; in hypertensive and normotensive patients treatment with an ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, can be started within 24 hours of the myocardial infarction and continued for at least 5–6 weeks (see below for long-term treatment).

All patients should be closely monitored for hyperglycaemia; those with diabetes or raised blood-glucose concentration should receive insulin.

Long-term management

Long-term management following STEMI involves the use of several drugs which should ideally be started before the patient is discharged from hospital.

Aspirin should be given to all patients, unless contra-indicated. The addition of clopidogrel has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. Prasugrel or ticagrelor are alternatives to clopidogrel in certain patients. For those intolerant of clopidogrel, and who are at low risk of bleeding, the combination of warfarin sodium and aspirin should be considered. In those intolerant of both aspirin and clopidogrel, warfarin sodium alone can be used. Warfarin sodium should be continued for those who are already being treated for another indication, such as atrial fibrillation, with the addition of aspirin if there is a low risk of bleeding. The combination of aspirin with clopidogrel or warfarin sodium increases the risk of bleeding. Low-dose rivaroxaban, in combination with aspirin alone oraspirin and clopidogrel, is licensed for the prevention of atherothrombotic events following STEMI—see Prevention of cardiovascular events. For details of antiplatelet drug duration following coronary stenting—see also Antiplatelet drugs and coronary stents in Antiplatelet drugs.

Beta-blockers should be given to all patients in whom they are not contra-indicated. Acebutolol, metoprolol tartrate, propranolol hydrochloride and timolol maleate are suitable; for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, carvedilol, bisoprolol fumarate, or long-acting metoprolol tartrate may be appropriate

Diltiazem hydrochloride [unlicensed] or verapamil hydrochloride can be considered if a beta-blocker cannot be used; however, they are contra-indicated in those with left ventricular dysfunction. Other calcium-channel blockers have no place in routine long-term management after a myocardial infarction.

An ACE inhibitor should be considered for all patients, especially those with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. If an ACE inhibitor cannot be used, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist may be used for patients with heart failure. A relatively high dose of either the ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist may be required to produce benefit.

Nitrates are used for patients with angina.

Eplerenone is licensed for use following a myocardial infarction in those with left ventricular dysfunction and evidence of heart failure.

Prevention of cardiovascular events

Patients with stable angina, unstable angina, or NSTEMI should be given advice and treatments to reduce their cardiovascular risk. The importance of life-style changes, especially stopping smoking, should be emphasised. Aspirin should be given indefinitely. Antihypertensive treatment should be initiated if appropriate, and a statin should also be given.

In patients with stable angina, addition of an ACE inhibitor should be considered for patients with diabetes (and should be continued if indicated for a co-morbidity).

In patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, clopidogrel is given, in combination with aspirin, for up to 12 months—most benefit occurs during the first 3 months. Prasugrel or ticagrelor are alternatives to clopidogrel in certain patients. An ACE inhibitor should also be given.

Low-dose rivaroxaban, in combination with aspirin alone oraspirin and clopidogrel, is licensed for the prevention of atherothrombotic events following an acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers.

Oral rehydration preparations are used in the prevention or reversal of fluid and electrolyte depletion. Severe depletion of fluid and electrolytes requires immediate admission to hospital and urgent replacement.

Antimotility drugs

Antimotility drugs relieve symptoms of acute diarrhoea by binding to opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby prolonging the duration of intestinal transit. They are used in the management of uncomplicated acute diarrhoea in adults, however, are not recommended for acute diarrhoea in young children; fluid and electrolyte replacement are of primary importance in severe cases of acute diarrhoea and may also be necessary in cases of dehydration.

Loperamide hydrochloride is used due to its action on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and because it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.Loperamide hydrochloride can also be used for faecal incontinence [unlicensed indication] after the underlying cause of incontinence has been addressed.

Antimotility drugs have a role in Inflammatory bowel disease and in Stoma care.

Antispasmodics

Antispasmodics are occasionally of value in treating abdominal cramp associated with diarrhoea but they should not be used for primary treatment. Antispasmodics and antiemetics should be avoided in young children with gastro-enteritis because they are rarely effective and have troublesome side-effects.

Antibacterial drugs

Antibacterial drugs are generally unnecessary in simple gastro-enteritis because the complaint usually resolves quickly without them, and infective diarrhoeas in the UK often have a viral cause. Systemic bacterial infection does, however, need appropriate systemic treatment.Ciprofloxacin is occasionally used for prophylaxis against travellers’ diarrhoea, but routine use is not recommended. Lactobacillus preparations have not been shown to be effective.

Adsorbents and bulk-forming drugs

Adsorbents such as kaolin are not recommended for acute diarrhoeas. Bulk-forming drugs, such as ispaghula husk, methylcellulose, and sterculia are useful in controlling diarrhoea associated with diverticular disease.

Colestyramine binds unabsorbed bile salts and provides symptomatic relief of diarrhoea following ileal disease or resection.

Enkephalinase inhibitors

Racecadotril is a pro-drug of thiorphan. Thiorphan is an enkephalinase inhibitor that inhibits the breakdown of endogenous opioids, thereby reducing intestinal secretions. Racecadotril is licensed, as an adjunct to rehydration, for the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated acute diarrhoea; it should only be used in children over 3 months of age when usual supportive measures, including oral rehydration, are insufficient to control the condition. Racecadotril does not affect the duration of intestinal transit.

The acute porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and 5- aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria) are hereditary disorders of haem biosynthesis; they have a prevalence of about 1 in 10 000 of the population.

Great care must be taken when prescribing for patients with acute porphyria, since certain drugs can induce acute porphyric crises. Since acute porphyrias are hereditary, relatives of affected individuals should be screened and advised about the potential danger of certain drugs.

Treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions should not be withheld from patients with acute porphyria. When there is no safe alternative, treatment should be started and urinary porphobilinogen excretion should be measured regularly; if it increases or symptoms occur, the drug can be withdrawn and the acute attack treated. If an acute attack of porphyria occurs during pregnancy, contact an expert porphyria service for further advice.

Haem arginate is administered by short intravenous infusion as haem replacement in moderate, severe, or unremitting acute porphyria crises.

In the United Kingdom the National Acute Porphyria Service (NAPS) provides clinical support and treatment with haem arginate from three centres (University Hospital of Wales, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, and King’s College Hospital). To access the service telephone (029) 2074 7747 and ask for the Acute Porphyria Service.

Drugs unsafe for use in acute porphyrias

The following list contains drugs on the UK market that have been classified as ‘unsafe’ in porphyria because they have been shown to be porphyrinogenic in animals or in vitro, or have been associated with acute attacks in patients. Absence of a drug from the following lists does not necessarily imply that the drug is safe. For many drugs no information about porphyria is available.

Unsafe Drug Groups (check first)

Alkylating drugs (contact Welsh Medicines Information Centre for further advice)Anabolic steroidsAntidepressants (includes tricyclic (and related) antidepressants and MAOIs; fluoxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and trazodone thought to be safe)Antihistamines (alimemazine, chlorphenamine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, ketotifen, loratadine, and promethazine thought to be safe)Barbiturates (includes primidone and thiopental)Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, felodipine, and nifedipine thought to be safe)Contraceptives, hormonal (progestogens are more porphyrinogenic than oestrogens; oestrogens may be safe at least in replacement doses.

Inhaled corticosteroids

An inhaled corticosteroid used for 3–4 weeks may help to distinguish asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; clear improvement over 3–4 weeks suggests asthma.

Corticosteroids are effective in asthma; they reduce airway inflammation (and hence reduce oedema and secretion of mucus into the airway).

An inhaled corticosteroid is used regularly for prophylaxis of asthma when patients require a beta2 agonist more than twice a week, or if symptoms disturb sleep at least once a week, or if the patient has suffered an exacerbation in the last 2 years requiring a systemic corticosteroid. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces the risk of exacerbation of asthma.

Current and previous smoking reduces the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids and higher doses may be necessary.

Corticosteroid inhalers must be used regularly for maximum benefit; alleviation of symptoms usually occurs 3 to 7 days after initiation. Beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone, and mometasone furoate appear to be equally effective. Preparations that combine a corticosteroid with a long-acting beta2 agonist may be helpful for patients stabilised on the individual components in the same proportion.

In adults using an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2 agonist for the prophylaxis of asthma, but who are poorly controlled, Symbicort or DuoResp Spiromax (both containing budesonide with formoterol) can be used as relievers (instead of a short-acting beta2 agonist), in addition to their regular use for the prophylaxis of asthma. Symbicort can also be used in this way in adults using an inhaled corticosteroid with a dose greater than beclometasone dipropionate 400 micrograms daily, but who are poorly controlled (standard doses of other inhaled corticosteroids can be used). When starting this treatment, the total regular daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid should not be reduced. Patients must be carefully instructed on the appropriate dose and management of exacerbations before initiating this therapy. Patients using budesonide with formoterol as a reliever once a day or more should have their treatment reviewed regularly. The use of Symbicort for both reliever and maintenance therapy is also used by some specialists in children 12–18 years [unlicensed]. Fostair can also be used in adults as a reliever (instead of a short-acting beta2 agonist) in addition to its regular use for the prophylaxis of asthma. It may be particularly useful for patients with poorly controlled asthma requiring reliever therapy, or for those who have had previous exacerbations of asthma which needed medical intervention. Patients requiring frequent daily use of Fostair  as a reliever should have their maintenance treatment reviewed. This approach has not been investigated with combination inhalers containing other corticosteroids and long-acting beta2 agonists.

High doses of inhaled corticosteroid can be prescribed for patients who respond only partially to standard doses with a long-acting beta2 agonist or another long-acting bronchodilator. High doses should be continued only if there is clear benefit over the lower dose. The recommended maximum dose of an inhaled corticosteroid should not generally be exceeded. However, if a higher dose is required, then it should be initiated and supervised by a specialist. The use of high doses of inhaled corticosteroid can minimise the requirement for an oral corticosteroid.

Oral corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroid therapy may be necessary during episodes of stress, such as severe infection, or if the asthma is worsening, when higher doses are needed and access of inhaled drug to small airways may be reduced; patients may need a reserve supply of corticosteroid tablets.

In chronic asthma, when the response to other drugs has been inadequate, longer term administration of an oral corticosteroid may be necessary; in such cases high doses of an inhaled corticosteroid should be continued to minimise oral corticosteroid requirements. Patients taking long-term oral corticosteroids for asthma can often be transferred to an inhaled corticosteroid but the transfer must be slow, with gradual reduction in the dose of the oral corticosteroid, and at a time when the asthma is well controlled.

An acute attack of asthma should be treated with a short course of an oral corticosteroid starting with a high dose. Patients whose asthma has deteriorated rapidly usually respond quickly to corticosteroids. The dose can usually be stopped abruptly; tapering is not needed provided that the patient receives an inhaled corticosteroid in an adequate dose (apart from those on maintenance oral corticosteroid treatment or where oral corticosteroids are required for 3 or more weeks). In patients who have needed several courses of oral corticosteroids and in whom the possibility of a period on maintenance corticosteroids is being considered, it may be useful to taper the corticosteroid dose gradually to identify a threshold dose for asthma control. This should only be done after other standard options for controlling asthma have been tried.

An oral corticosteroid should normally be taken as a single dose in the morning to reduce the disturbance to circadian cortisol secretion. Dosage should always be titrated to the lowest dose that controls symptoms. Regular peak-flow measurements help to optimise the dose.

Parenteral corticosteroids

Hydrocortisone injection has a role in the emergency treatment of acute severe asthma.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Inhaled corticosteroids

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease inhaled corticosteroid therapy may reduce exacerbations when given in combination with an inhaled long-acting beta2 agonist.

Oral corticosteroids

During an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prednisolone should be given; treatment can be stopped abruptly. Prolonged treatment with oral prednisolone is of no benefit and maintenance treatment is not normally recommended.

These include amikacin, gentamicin, neomycin sulfate, streptomycin, and tobramycin. All are bactericidal and active against some Gram-positive and many Gram-negative organisms. Amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin are also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; streptomycin is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is now almost entirely reserved for tuberculosis.

The aminoglycosides are not absorbed from the gut (although there is a risk of absorption in inflammatory bowel disease and liver failure) and must therefore be given by injection for systemic infections.

Gentamicin is the aminoglycoside of choice in the UK and is used widely for the treatment of serious infections. It has a broad spectrum but is inactive against anaerobes and has poor activity against haemolytic streptococci and pneumococci. When used for the ‘blind’ therapy of undiagnosed serious infections it is usually given in conjunction with a penicillin or metronidazole (or both). Gentamicin is used together with another antibiotic for the treatment of endocarditis. Streptomycin may be used as an alternative in gentamicin-resistant enterococcal endocarditis.

Loading and maintenance doses of gentamicin may be calculated on the basis of the patient’s weight and renal function (e.g. using a nomogram); adjustments are then made according to serum-gentamicin concentrations. High doses are occasionally indicated for serious infections, especially in the neonate, in the patient with cystic fibrosis, or in the immunocompromised patient. Whenever possible treatment should not exceed 7 days.

Amikacin is more stable than gentamicin to enzyme inactivation. Amikacin is used in the treatment of serious infections caused by gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

Tobramycin has similar activity to gentamicin. It is slightly more active against Ps. aeruginosa but shows less activity against certain other Gram-negative bacteria. Tobramycin can be administered by nebuliser or by inhalation of powder on a cyclical basis (28 days of tobramycin followed by a 28-day tobramycin-free interval) for the treatment of chronic pulmonary Ps. aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis; however, resistance may develop and some patients do not respond to treatment.

Neomycin sulfate is too toxic for parenteral administration and can only be used for infections of the skin or mucous membranes or to reduce the bacterial population of the colon prior to bowel surgery or in hepatic failure. Oral administration may lead to malabsorption. Small amounts of neomycin sulfate may be absorbed from the gut in patients with hepatic failure and, as these patients may also be uraemic, cumulation may occur with resultant ototoxicity.

Once daily dosage

Once daily administration of aminoglycosides is more convenient, provides adequate serum concentrations, and in many cases has largely superseded multiple daily dose regimens (given in 2–3 divided doses during the 24 hours). Local guidelines on dosage and serum concentrations should be consulted. A once-daily, high-dose regimen of an aminoglycoside should be avoided in patients with endocarditis due to Gram-positive bacteria, HACEK endocarditis, burns of more than 20% of the total body surface area, or creatinine clearance less than 20 mL/minute. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a once daily, high-dose regimen of an aminoglycoside in pregnancy.

Serum concentrations

Serum concentration monitoring avoids both excessive and subtherapeutic concentrations thus preventing toxicity and ensuring efficacy. Serum-aminoglycoside concentrations should be monitored in patients receiving parenteral aminoglycosides and must be determined in the elderly, in obesity, and in cystic fibrosis, or if high doses are being given, or if there is renal impairment.

Treatment with an iron preparation is justified only in the presence of a demonstrable iron-deficiency state. Before starting treatment, it is important to exclude any serious underlying cause of the anaemia (e.g. gastric erosion, gastro-intestinal cancer).

Prophylaxis with an iron preparation may be appropriate in malabsorption, menorrhagia, pregnancy, after subtotal or total gastrectomy, in haemodialysis patients, and in the management of low birth-weight infants such as preterm neonates.

Oral iron

Iron salts should be given by mouth unless there are good reasons for using another route.

Ferrous salts show only marginal differences between one another in efficiency of absorption of iron. Haemoglobin regeneration rate is little affected by the type of salt used provided sufficient iron is given, and in most patients the speed of response is not critical.

Preparations containing iron and folic acid are used during pregnancy in women who are at high risk of developing iron and folic acid deficiency; they should be distinguished from those used for the prevention of neural tube defects in women planning a pregnancy.

It is important to note that the small doses of folic acid contained in these preparations are inadequate for the treatment of megaloblastic anaemias.

Some oral preparations contain ascorbic acid to aid absorption of the iron but the therapeutic advantage of such preparations is minimal and cost may be increased.

There is no justification for the inclusion of other ingredients, such as the B group of vitamins (except folic acid for pregnant women).

Modified-release preparations

Modified-release preparations of iron are licensed for once-daily dosage, but have no therapeutic advantage and should not be used. These preparations are formulated to release iron gradually; the low incidence of side-effects may reflect the small amounts of iron available for absorption as the iron is carried past the first part of the duodenum into an area of the gut where absorption may be poor.

Parenteral iron

Iron can be administered parenterally as iron dextran, iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, or iron isomaltoside 1000. Parenteral iron is generally reserved for use when oral therapy is unsuccessful because the patient cannot tolerate oral iron, or does not take it reliably, or if there is continuing blood loss, or in malabsorption. Parenteral iron may also have a role in the management of chemotherapy-induced anaemia, when given with erythropoietins, in specific patient groups (see NICE guidance).

Many patients with chronic renal failure who are receiving haemodialysis (and some who are receiving peritoneal dialysis) also require iron by the intravenous route on a regular basis.

With the exception of patients with severe renal failure receiving haemodialysis, parenteral iron does not produce a faster haemoglobin response than oral iron provided that the oral iron preparation is taken reliably and is absorbed adequately. If parenteral iron is necessary, the dose should be calculated according to the patient’s body-weight and total iron deficit. Depending on the preparation used, parenteral iron is given as a total dose or in divided doses. Further treatment should be guided by monitoring haemoglobin and serum iron concentrations.

Most megaloblastic anaemias result from a lack of either vitamin B12 or folate, and it is essential to establish in every case which deficiency is present and the underlying cause. In emergencies, when delay might be dangerous, it is sometimes necessary to administer both substances after the bone marrow test while plasma assay results are awaited. Normally, however, appropriate treatment should not be instituted until the results of tests are available.

One cause of megaloblastic anaemia in the UK is pernicious anaemia in which lack of gastric intrinsic factor resulting from an autoimmune gastritis causes malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Vitamin B12 is also needed in the treatment of megaloblastosis caused by prolonged nitrous oxide anaesthesia, which inactivates the vitamin, and in the rare syndrome of congenital transcobalamin II deficiency.

Vitamin B12 should be given prophylactically after total gastrectomy or total ileal resection(or after partial gastrectomy if a vitamin B12 absorption test shows vitamin B12 malabsorption).

Apart from dietary deficiency, all other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency are attributable to malabsorption. There is little place for the use of low-dose vitamin B12 orally and none for vitamin B12 intrinsic factor complexes given by mouth. Vitamin B12 in larger oral doses [unlicensed] may be effective.

Hydroxocobalamin has completely replaced cyanocobalamin as the form of vitamin B12 of choice for therapy; it is retained in the body longer than cyanocobalamin and thus for maintenance therapy can be given at intervals of up to 3 months. Treatment is generally initiated with frequent administration of intramuscular injections to replenish the depleted body stores. Thereafter, maintenance treatment, which is usually for life, can be instituted. There is no evidence that doses larger than those recommended provide any additional benefit in vitamin B12 neuropathy.

Folic acid has few indications for long-term therapy since most causes of folate deficiency are self-limiting or will yield to a short course of treatment. It should not be used in undiagnosed megaloblastic anaemia unless vitamin B12 is administered concurrently otherwise neuropathy may be precipitated.

In folate-deficient megaloblastic anaemia (e.g. because of poor nutrition, pregnancy, or antiepileptic drugs), daily folic acid supplementation for 4 months brings about haematological remission and replenishes body stores.

For prophylaxis in chronic haemolytic states, malabsorption, or in renal dialysis, folic acid is given daily or sometimes weekly, depending on the diet and the rate of haemolysis.

Folic acid is also used for the prevention of methotrexate- induced side-effects in severe Crohn’s disease, rheumatic disease, and severe psoriasis.

Folinic acid is also effective in the treatment of folate deficient megaloblastic anaemia but it is generally used in association with cytotoxic drugs; it is given as calcium folinate.

There is no justification for prescribing multiple ingredient vitamin preparations containing vitamin B12 or folic acid.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">G6PD deficiency</p>
    <p>Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is highly prevalent in individuals originating from most parts of Africa, from most parts of Asia, from Oceania, and from Southern Europe; it can also occur, rarely, in any other individuals. G6PD deficiency is more common in males than it is in females.</p>
    <p>Individuals with G6PD deficiency are susceptible to developing acute haemolytic anaemia when they take a number of common drugs. They are also susceptible to developing acute haemolytic anaemia when they eat fava beans (broad beans, <i>Vicia faba</i>); this is termed <i>favism</i> and can be more severe in children or when the fresh fava beans are eaten raw.</p>
    <p>When prescribing drugs for patients with G6PD deficiency, the following three points should be kept in mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>G6PD deficiency is genetically heterogeneous; susceptibility to the haemolytic risk from drugs varies; thus, a drug found to be safe in some G6PD-deficient individuals may not be equally safe in others;</li>
      <li>manufacturers do not routinely test drugs for their effects in G6PD-deficient individuals;</li>
      <li>the risk and severity of haemolysis is almost always dose-related.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The lists below should be read with these points in mind. Ideally, information about G6PD deficiency should be available before prescribing a drug listed below. However, in the absence of this information, the possibility of haemolysis should be considered, especially if the patient belongs to a group in which G6PD deficiency is common.</p>
    <p>A very few G6PD-deficient individuals with chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia have haemolysis even in the absence of an exogenous trigger. These patients must be regarded as being at high risk of severe exacerbation of haemolysis following administration of any of the drugs listed below.</p>

Before initiating treatment for anaemia it is essential to determine which type is present. Iron salts may be harmful and result in iron overload if given alone to patients with anaemias other than those due to iron deficiency.

Sickle-cell anaemia

Sickle-cell disease is caused by a structural abnormality of haemoglobin resulting in deformed, less flexible red blood cells. Acute complications in the more severe forms include sickle-cell crisis, where infarction of the microvasculature and blood supply to organs results in severe pain. Sickle-cell crisis requires hospitalisation, intravenous fluids, analgesia and treatment of any concurrent infection. Chronic complications include skin ulceration, renal failure, and increased susceptibility to infection.

Hepatitis B vaccine should be considered if the patient is not immune.

In most forms of sickle-cell disease, varying degrees of haemolytic anaemia are present accompanied by increased erythropoiesis; this may increase folate requirements and folate supplementation may be necessary.

Hydroxycarbamide can reduce the frequency of crises and the need for blood transfusions in sickle-cell disease. The beneficial effects of hydroxycarbamide may not become evident for several months.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is highly prevalent in individuals originating from most parts of Africa, from most parts of Asia, from Oceania, and from Southern Europe; it can also occur, rarely, in any other individuals. G6PD deficiency is more common in males than it is in females.

Individuals with G6PD deficiency are susceptible to developing acute haemolytic anaemia when they take a number of common drugs. They are also susceptible to developing acute haemolytic anaemia when they eat fava beans (broad beans, Vicia faba); this is termed favism and can be more severe in children or when the fresh fava beans are eaten raw.

When prescribing drugs for patients with G6PD deficiency, the following three points should be kept in mind:

G6PD deficiency is genetically heterogeneous; susceptibility to the haemolytic risk from drugs varies; thus, a drug found to be safe in some G6PD-deficient individuals may not be equally safe in others;manufacturers do not routinely test drugs for their effects in G6PD-deficient individuals;the risk and severity of haemolysis is almost always dose-related.The lists below should be read with these points in mind. Ideally, information about G6PD deficiency should be available before prescribing a drug listed below. However, in the absence of this information, the possibility of haemolysis should be considered, especially if the patient belongs to a group in which G6PD deficiency is common.

A very few G6PD-deficient individuals with chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia have haemolysis even in the absence of an exogenous trigger. These patients must be regarded as being at high risk of severe exacerbation of haemolysis following administration of any of the drugs listed below.

Drugs with definite risk of haemolysis in most G6PD-deficient individuals

Dapsone and other sulfones (higher doses for dermatitis herpetiformis more likely to cause problems)Methylthioninium chlorideNiridazole [not on UK market]NitrofurantoinPamaquin [not on UK market]Primaquine (30 mg weekly for 8 weeks has been found to be without undue harmful effects in African and Asian people)Quinolones (including ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin)RasburicaseSulfonamides (including co-trimoxazole; some sulfonamides, e.g. sulfadiazine, have been tested and found not to be haemolytic in many G6PD-deficient individuals)Drugs with possible risk of haemolysis in some G6PD-deficient individuals

Aspirin (acceptable up to a dose of at least 1 g daily in most G6PD-deficient individuals)Chloroquine (acceptable in acute malaria and malaria chemoprophylaxis)Menadione, water-soluble derivatives (e.g. menadiol sodium phosphate)Quinidine (acceptable in acute malaria) [not on UK market]Quinine (acceptable in acute malaria)SulfonylureasNaphthalene in mothballs also causes haemolysis in individuals with Gana6PD deficiency.

Drugs used in hypoplastic, haemolytic, and renal anaemias

Anabolic steroids, pyridoxine hydrochloride, antilymphocyte immunoglobulin, and various corticosteroids are used in hypoplastic and haemolytic anaemias.

Antilymphocyte immunoglobulin given intravenously through a central line over 12–18 hours each day for 5 days produces a response in about 50% of cases of acquired aplastic anaemia; the response rate may be increased when ciclosporin is given as well. Severe reactions are common in the first 2 days and profound immunosuppression can occur; antilymphocyte immunoglobulin should be given under specialist supervision with appropriate resuscitation facilities. Alternatively, oxymetholone tablets (available from ‘special order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) can be used in aplastic anaemia for 3 to 6 months.

It is unlikely that dietary deprivation of pyridoxine hydrochloride produces clinically relevant haematological effects. However, certain forms of sideroblastic anaemia respond to pharmacological doses, possibly reflecting its role as a co-enzyme during haemoglobin synthesis. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is indicated in both idiopathic acquired and hereditary sideroblastic anaemias. Although complete cures have not been reported, some increase in haemoglobin can occur; the dose required is usually high. Reversible sideroblastic anaemias respond to treatment of the underlying cause but in pregnancy, haemolytic anaemias, and alcohol dependence, or during isoniazid treatment, pyridoxine hydrochloride is also indicated.

Corticosteroids have an important place in the management of haematological disorders. They include conditions with an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenias and neutropenias, and major transfusion reactions. They are also used in chemotherapy schedules for many types of lymphoma, lymphoid leukaemias, and paraproteinaemias, including multiple myeloma.

Erythropoietins

Epoetins (recombinant human erythropoietins) are used to treat the anaemia associated with erythropoietin deficiency in chronic renal failure, to increase the yield of autologous blood in normal individuals and to shorten the period of symptomatic anaemia in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Epoetin beta is also used for the prevention of anaemia in preterm neonates of low birth-weight; only unpreserved formulations should be used in neonates because other preparations may contain benzyl alcohol.

Darbepoetin alfa is a hyperglycosylated derivative of epoetin; it has a longer half life and can be administered less frequently than epoetin.

Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator that is licensed for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease. It has a longer duration of action than epoetin.

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Dental and orofacial pain</p>
      <p>Analgesics should be used judiciously in dental care as a <b>temporary</b> measure until the cause of the pain has been dealt with.</p>
      <p>Dental pain of inflammatory origin, such as that associated with pulpitis, apical infection, localised osteitis or pericoronitis is usually best managed by treating the infection, providing drainage, restorative procedures, and other local measures. Analgesics provide temporary relief of pain (usually for about 1 to 7 days) until the causative factors have been brought under control. In the case of pulpitis, intra-osseous infection or abscess, reliance on analgesics alone is usually inappropriate.</p>
      <p>Similarly the pain and discomfort associated with acute problems of the oral mucosa (e.g. acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, erythema multiforme) may be relieved by <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzydamine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7348\">benzydamine hydrochloride</xref> mouthwash or spray until the cause of the mucosal disorder has been dealt with. However, where a patient is febrile, the antipyretic action of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ibuprofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6461\">ibuprofen</xref> is often helpful.</p>
      <p>The <i>choice</i> of an analgesic for dental purposes should be based on its suitability for the patient. Most dental pain is relieved effectively by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs that are used for dental pain include <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ibuprofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6461\">ibuprofen</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diclofenac-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6427\">diclofenac sodium</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">Paracetamol</xref> has analgesic and antipyretic effects but no anti-inflammatory effect.</p>
      <p>Opioid analgesics such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dihydrocodeine-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2702\">dihydrocodeine tartrate</xref> act on the central nervous system and are traditionally used for <i>moderate to severe pain</i>. However, opioid analgesics are relatively ineffective in dental pain and their side-effects can be unpleasant. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">Paracetamol</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ibuprofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6461\">ibuprofen</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> are adequate for most cases of dental pain and an opioid is rarely required.</p>
      <p>Combining a non-opioid with an opioid analgesic can provide greater relief of pain than either analgesic given alone. However, this applies only when an adequate dose of each analgesic is used. Most combination analgesic preparations have not been shown to provide greater relief of pain than an adequate dose of the non-opioid component given alone. Moreover, combination preparations have the disadvantage of an increased number of side-effects.</p>
      <p>Any analgesic given before a dental procedure should have a low risk of increasing postoperative bleeding. In the case of pain after the dental procedure, taking an analgesic before the effect of the local anaesthetic has worn off can improve control. Postoperative analgesia with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ibuprofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6461\">ibuprofen</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> is usually continued for about 24 to 72 hours.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Temporomandibular dysfunction</i> can be related to anxiety in some patients who may clench or grind their teeth (bruxism) during the day or night. The muscle spasm (which appears to be the main source of pain) may be treated empirically with an overlay appliance which provides a free sliding occlusion and may also interfere with grinding. In addition, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diazepam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2159\">diazepam</xref>, which has muscle relaxant as well as anxiolytic properties, may be helpful but it should only be prescribed on a short-term basis during the acute phase. Analgesics such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ibuprofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6461\">ibuprofen</xref> may also be required.</p>

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Dysmenorrhoea</p>
      <p>Use of an oral contraceptive prevents the pain of dysmenorrhoea which is generally associated with ovulatory cycles. If treatment is necessary <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> or a NSAID will generally provide adequate relief of pain. The vomiting and severe pain associated with dysmenorrhoea in women with endometriosis may call for an antiemetic (in addition to an analgesic). Antispasmodics (such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/alverine-citrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP373\">alverine citrate</xref>) have been advocated for dysmenorrhoea but the antispasmodic action does not generally provide significant relief.</p>

The non-opioid drugs, paracetamol and aspirin (and other NSAIDs), are particularly suitable for pain in musculoskeletal conditions, whereas the opioid analgesics are more suitable for moderate to severe pain, particularly of visceral origin.

Pain in sickle-cell disease

The pain of mild sickle-cell crises is managed with paracetamol, a NSAID, codeine phosphate, or dihydrocodeine tartrate. Severe crises may require the use of morphine or diamorphine hydrochloride; concomitant use of a NSAID may potentiate analgesia and allow lower doses of the opioid to be used. Pethidine hydrochloride should be avoided if possible because accumulation of a neurotoxic metabolite can precipitate seizures; the relatively short half-life of pethidine hydrochloride necessitates frequent injections.

Dental and orofacial pain

Analgesics should be used judiciously in dental care as a temporary measure until the cause of the pain has been dealt with.

Dental pain of inflammatory origin, such as that associated with pulpitis, apical infection, localised osteitis or pericoronitis is usually best managed by treating the infection, providing drainage, restorative procedures, and other local measures. Analgesics provide temporary relief of pain (usually for about 1 to 7 days) until the causative factors have been brought under control. In the case of pulpitis, intra-osseous infection or abscess, reliance on analgesics alone is usually inappropriate.

Similarly the pain and discomfort associated with acute problems of the oral mucosa (e.g. acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, erythema multiforme) may be relieved by benzydamine hydrochloride mouthwash or spray until the cause of the mucosal disorder has been dealt with. However, where a patient is febrile, the antipyretic action of paracetamol or ibuprofen is often helpful.

The choice of an analgesic for dental purposes should be based on its suitability for the patient. Most dental pain is relieved effectively by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs that are used for dental pain include ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium, and aspirin. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic effects but no anti-inflammatory effect.

Opioid analgesics such as dihydrocodeine tartrate act on the central nervous system and are traditionally used for moderate to severe pain. However, opioid analgesics are relatively ineffective in dental pain and their side-effects can be unpleasant. Paracetamol, ibuprofen, or aspirin are adequate for most cases of dental pain and an opioid is rarely required.

Combining a non-opioid with an opioid analgesic can provide greater relief of pain than either analgesic given alone. However, this applies only when an adequate dose of each analgesic is used. Most combination analgesic preparations have not been shown to provide greater relief of pain than an adequate dose of the non-opioid component given alone. Moreover, combination preparations have the disadvantage of an increased number of side-effects.

Any analgesic given before a dental procedure should have a low risk of increasing postoperative bleeding. In the case of pain after the dental procedure, taking an analgesic before the effect of the local anaesthetic has worn off can improve control. Postoperative analgesia with ibuprofen or aspirin is usually continued for about 24 to 72 hours.

Temporomandibular dysfunction can be related to anxiety in some patients who may clench or grind their teeth (bruxism) during the day or night. The muscle spasm (which appears to be the main source of pain) may be treated empirically with an overlay appliance which provides a free sliding occlusion and may also interfere with grinding. In addition, diazepam, which has muscle relaxant as well as anxiolytic properties, may be helpful but it should only be prescribed on a short-term basis during the acute phase. Analgesics such as aspirin or ibuprofen may also be required.

Dysmenorrhoea

Use of an oral contraceptive prevents the pain of dysmenorrhoea which is generally associated with ovulatory cycles. If treatment is necessary paracetamol or a NSAID will generally provide adequate relief of pain. The vomiting and severe pain associated with dysmenorrhoea in women with endometriosis may call for an antiemetic (in addition to an analgesic). Antispasmodics (such as alverine citrate) have been advocated for dysmenorrhoea but the antispasmodic action does not generally provide significant relief.

Non-opioid analgesics and compound analgesic preparations

Aspirin is indicated for headache, transient musculoskeletal pain, dysmenorrhoea, and pyrexia. In inflammatory conditions, most physicians prefer anti-inflammatory treatment with another NSAID which may be better tolerated and more convenient for the patient. Aspirin is used increasingly for its antiplatelet properties. Aspirin tablets or dispersible aspirin tablets are adequate for most purposes as they act rapidly.

Gastric irritation may be a problem; it is minimised by taking the dose after food. Enteric-coated preparations are available, but have a slow onset of action and are therefore unsuitable for single-dose analgesic use (though their prolonged action may be useful for night pain).

Aspirin interacts significantly with a number of other drugs and its interaction with warfarin sodium is a special hazard.

Paracetamol is similar in efficacy to aspirin, but has no demonstrable anti-inflammatory activity; it is less irritant to the stomach and for that reason is now generally preferred to aspirin, particularly in the elderly. Overdosage with paracetamol is particularly dangerous as it may cause hepatic damage which is sometimes not apparent for 4 to 6 days.

Nefopam hydrochloride may have a place in the relief of persistent pain unresponsive to other non-opioid analgesics. It causes little or no respiratory depression, but sympathomimetic and antimuscarinic side-effects may be troublesome.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIDs) are particularly useful for the treatment of patients with chronic disease accompanied by pain and inflammation. Some of them are also used in the short-term treatment of mild to moderate pain including transient musculoskeletal pain but paracetamol is now often preferred, particularly in the elderly. They are also suitable for the relief of pain in dysmenorrhoea and to treat pain caused by secondary bone tumours, many of which produce lysis of bone and release prostaglandins. Selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 may be used in preference to non-selective NSAIDs for patients at high risk of developing serious gastro-intestinal side-effects. Several NSAIDs are also used for postoperative analgesia.

A non-opioid analgesic administered by intrathecal infusion (ziconotide (Prialt), available from Eisai) is licensed for the treatment of chronic severe pain; ziconotide can be used by a hospital specialist as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.

Compound analgesic preparations

Compound analgesic preparations that contain a simple analgesic (such as aspirin or paracetamol) with an opioid component reduce the scope for effective titration of the individual components in the management of pain of varying intensity.

Compound analgesic preparations containing paracetamol or aspirin with a low dose of an opioid analgesic (e.g. 8 mg of codeine phosphate per compound tablet) are commonly used, but the advantages have not been substantiated. The low dose of the opioid may be enough to cause opioid side-effects (in particular, constipation) and can complicate the treatment of overdosage yet may not provide significant additional relief of pain.

A full dose of the opioid component (e.g. 60 mg codeine phosphate) in compound analgesic preparations effectively augments the analgesic activity but is associated with the full range of opioid side-effects (including nausea, vomiting, severe constipation, drowsiness, respiratory depression, and risk of dependence on long-term administration). Important: the elderly are particularly susceptible to opioid side-effects and should receive lower doses.

In general, when assessing pain, it is necessary to weigh up carefully whether there is a need for a non-opioid and an opioid analgesic to be taken simultaneously.

Caffeine is a weak stimulant that is often included, in small doses, in analgesic preparations. It is claimed that the addition of caffeine may enhance the analgesic effect, but the alerting effect, mild habit-forming effect and possible provocation of headache may not always be desirable. Moreover, in excessive dosage or on withdrawal caffeine may itself induce headache.

Co-proxamol tablets (dextropropoxyphene in combination with paracetamol) are no longer licensed because of safety concerns, particularly toxicity in overdose. Co-proxamol tablets [unlicensed] may still be prescribed for patients who find it difficult to change, because alternatives are not effective or suitable.

Opioid analgesics

Opioid analgesics are usually used to relieve moderate to severe pain particularly of visceral origin. Repeated administration may cause dependence and tolerance, but this is no deterrent in the control of pain in terminal illness. Regular use of a potent opioid may be appropriate for certain cases of chronic non-malignant pain; treatment should be supervised by a specialist and the patient should be assessed at regular intervals.

Strong opioids

Morphine remains the most valuable opioid analgesic for severe pain although it frequently causes nausea and vomiting. It is the standard against which other opioid analgesics are compared. In addition to relief of pain, morphine also confers a state of euphoria and mental detachment.

Morphine is the opioid of choice for the oral treatment of severe pain in palliative care. It is given regularly every 4 hours (or every 12 or 24 hours as modified-release preparations).

Buprenorphine has both opioid agonist and antagonist properties and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms, including pain, in patients dependent on other opioids. It has abuse potential and may itself cause dependence. It has a much longer duration of action than morphine and sublingually is an effective analgesic for 6 to 8 hours. Unlike most opioid analgesics, the effects of buprenorphine are only partially reversed by naloxone hydrochloride.

Dipipanone hydrochloride used alone is less sedating than morphine but the only preparation available contains an antiemetic and is therefore not suitable for regular regimens in palliative care.

Diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin) is a powerful opioid analgesic. It may cause less nausea and hypotension than morphine. In palliative care the greater solubility of diamorphine hydrochloride allows effective doses to be injected in smaller volumes and this is important in the emaciated patient.

Alfentanil, fentanyl and remifentanil are used by injection for intra-operative analgesia; fentanyl is available in a transdermal drug delivery system as a self-adhesive patch which is changed every 72 hours.

Methadone hydrochloride is less sedating than morphine and acts for longer periods. In prolonged use, methadone hydrochloride should not be administered more often than twice daily to avoid the risk of accumulation and opioid overdosage. Methadone hydrochloride may be used instead of morphine in the occasional patient who experiences excitation (or exacerbation of pain) with morphine.

Oxycodone hydrochloride has an efficacy and side-effect profile similar to that of morphine. It is used primarily for control of pain in palliative care.

Papaveretum is rarely used; morphine is easier to prescribe and less prone to error with regard to the strength and dose.

Pentazocine has both agonist and antagonist properties and precipitates withdrawal symptoms, including pain in patients dependent on other opioids. By injection it is more potent than dihydrocodeine tartrate or codeine phosphate, but hallucinations and thought disturbances may occur. It is not recommended and, in particular, should be avoided after myocardial infarction as it may increase pulmonary and aortic blood pressure as well as cardiac work.

Pethidine hydrochloride produces prompt but short-lasting analgesia; it is less constipating than morphine, but even in high doses is a less potent analgesic. It is not suitable for severe continuing pain. It is used for analgesia in labour; however, other opioids, such as morphine or diamorphine hydrochloride, are often preferred for obstetric pain.

Tapentadol produces analgesia by two mechanisms. It is an opioid-receptor agonist and it also inhibits noradrenaline reuptake. Nausea, vomiting, and constipation are less likely to occur with tapentadol than with other strong opioid analgesics.

Tramadol hydrochloride produces analgesia by two mechanisms: an opioid effect and an enhancement of serotonergic and adrenergic pathways. It has fewer of the typical opioid side-effects (notably, less respiratory depression, less constipation and less addiction potential); psychiatric reactions have been reported.

Weak opioids

Codeine phosphate can be used for the relief of mild to moderate pain where other painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen have proved ineffective.

Dihydrocodeine tartrate has an analgesic efficacy similar to that of codeine phosphate. Higher doses may provide some additional pain relief but this may be at the cost of more nausea and vomiting.

Meptazinol is claimed to have a low incidence of repiratory depression. It has a reported length of action of 2 to 7 hours with onset within 15 minutes.

Postoperative analgesia

A combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics is used to treat postoperative pain. The use of intra-operative opioids affects the prescribing of postoperative analgesics. A postoperative opioid analgesic should be given with care since it may potentiate any residual respiratory depression.

Morphine is used most widely. Tramadol hydrochloride is not as effective in severe pain as other opioid analgesics. Buprenorphine may antagonise the analgesic effect of previously administered opioids and is generally not recommended. Pethidine hydrochloride is generally not recommended for postoperative pain because it is metabolised to norpethidine which may accumulate, particularly in renal impairment; norpethidine stimulates the central nervous system and may cause convulsions.

Opioids are also given epidurally [unlicensed route] in the postoperative period but are associated with side-effects such as pruritus, urinary retention, nausea and vomiting; respiratory depression can be delayed, particularly with morphine.

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) can be used to relieve postoperative pain—consult individual hospital protocols.

Pain management and opioid dependence

Although caution is necessary, patients who are dependent on opioids or have a history of drug dependence may be treated with opioid analgesics when there is a clinical need. Treatment with opioid analgesics in this patient group should normally be carried out with the advice of specialists. However, doctors do not require a special licence to prescribe opioid analgesics to patients with opioid dependence for relief of pain due to organic disease or injury.

Anti-androgens

Cyproterone acetate

Cyproterone acetate is an anti-androgen used in the treatment of severe hypersexuality and sexual deviation in the male. It inhibits spermatogenesis and produces reversible infertility (but is not a male contraceptive); abnormal sperm forms are produced. Fully informed consent is recommended and an initial spermatogram. As hepatic tumours have been produced in animal studies, careful consideration should be given to the risk/benefit ratio before treatment. Cyproterone acetate is also licensed for use alone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer refractory to gonadorelin analogue therapy and has been used as an adjunct in prostatic cancer and in the treatment of acne and hirsutism in women.

Dutasteride and finasteride

Dutasteride and finasteride are alternatives to alpha-blockers particularly in men with a significantly enlarged prostate. Finasteride is also licensed for use with doxazosin in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

A low strength of finasteride is licensed for treating male-pattern baldness in men.

Anabolic steroids

Anabolic steroids have some androgenic activity but they cause less virilisation than androgens in women. They are used in the treatment of some aplastic anaemias. Anabolic steroids have been given for osteoporosis in women but they are no longer advocated for this purpose.

The protein-building properties of anabolic steroids have not proved beneficial in the clinical setting. Their use as body builders or tonics is unjustified; some athletes abuse them.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Antacids (usually containing aluminium or magnesium compounds) can often relieve symptoms in <i>ulcer dyspepsia</i> and in <i>non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux </i>; they are also sometimes used in functional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia but the evidence of benefit is uncertain. Antacids are best given when symptoms occur or are expected, usually between meals and at bedtime, although additional doses may be required. Conventional doses of liquid magnesium–aluminium antacids promote ulcer healing, but less well than antisecretory drugs; proof of a relationship between healing and neutralising capacity is lacking. Liquid preparations are more effective than tablet preparations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Aluminium-</b> and <b>magnesium-containing</b> antacids (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aluminium-hydroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP287\">aluminium hydroxide</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/magnesium-carbonate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP298\">magnesium carbonate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-magaldrox.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP88129\">co-magaldrox</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/magnesium-trisilicate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP304\">magnesium trisilicate</xref>), being relatively insoluble in water, are long-acting if retained in the stomach. They are suitable for most antacid purposes. Magnesium-containing antacids tend to be laxative whereas aluminium-containing antacids may be constipating; antacids containing both magnesium and aluminium may reduce these colonic side-effects. Aluminium accumulation does not appear to be a risk if renal function is normal.</p>
    <p>The acid-neutralising capacity of preparations that contain more than one antacid may be the same as simpler preparations. Complexes such as <b>hydrotalcite</b> confer no special advantage.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-bicarbonate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5118\">Sodium bicarbonate</xref> should no longer be prescribed alone for the relief of dyspepsia but it is present as an ingredient in many indigestion remedies. However, it retains a place in the management of urinary-tract disorders and acidosis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Bismuth-containing</b> antacids (unless chelates) are not recommended because absorbed bismuth can be neurotoxic, causing encephalopathy; they tend to be constipating. <b>Calcium-containing</b> antacids can induce rebound acid secretion: with modest doses the clinical significance is doubtful, but prolonged high doses also cause hypercalcaemia and alkalosis, and can precipitate the milk-alkali syndrome.</p>

Antacids (usually containing aluminium or magnesium compounds) can often relieve symptoms in ulcer dyspepsia and in non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux ; they are also sometimes used in functional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia but the evidence of benefit is uncertain. Antacids are best given when symptoms occur or are expected, usually between meals and at bedtime, although additional doses may be required. Conventional doses of liquid magnesium–aluminium antacids promote ulcer healing, but less well than antisecretory drugs; proof of a relationship between healing and neutralising capacity is lacking. Liquid preparations are more effective than tablet preparations.

Aluminium- and magnesium-containing antacids (e.g. aluminium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, co-magaldrox and magnesium trisilicate), being relatively insoluble in water, are long-acting if retained in the stomach. They are suitable for most antacid purposes. Magnesium-containing antacids tend to be laxative whereas aluminium-containing antacids may be constipating; antacids containing both magnesium and aluminium may reduce these colonic side-effects. Aluminium accumulation does not appear to be a risk if renal function is normal.

The acid-neutralising capacity of preparations that contain more than one antacid may be the same as simpler preparations. Complexes such as hydrotalcite confer no special advantage.

Sodium bicarbonate should no longer be prescribed alone for the relief of dyspepsia but it is present as an ingredient in many indigestion remedies. However, it retains a place in the management of urinary-tract disorders and acidosis.

Bismuth-containing antacids (unless chelates) are not recommended because absorbed bismuth can be neurotoxic, causing encephalopathy; they tend to be constipating. Calcium-containing antacids can induce rebound acid secretion: with modest doses the clinical significance is doubtful, but prolonged high doses also cause hypercalcaemia and alkalosis, and can precipitate the milk-alkali syndrome.

 Simeticone

Simeticone (activated dimeticone) is added to an antacid as an antifoaming agent to relieve flatulence. These preparations may be useful for the relief of hiccup in palliative care.

Alginates

Alginates taken in combination with an antacid increases the viscosity of stomach contents and can protect the oesophageal mucosa from acid reflux. Some alginate-containing preparations form a viscous gel (‘raft’) that floats on the surface of the stomach contents, thereby reducing symptoms of reflux.

The amount of additional ingredient or antacid in individual preparations varies widely, as does their sodium content, so that preparations may not be freely interchangeable.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Choice of a suitable drug</p>
    <p>Before selecting an antibacterial the clinician must first consider two factors— the patient and the known or likely causative organism. Factors related to the patient which must be considered include history of allergy, renal and hepatic function, susceptibility to infection (i.e. whether immunocompromised), ability to tolerate drugs by mouth, severity of illness, ethnic origin, age, whether taking other medication and, if female, whether pregnant, breast-feeding or taking an oral contraceptive.</p>
    <p>The known or likely organism and its antibacterial sensitivity, in association with the above factors, will suggest one or more antibacterials, the final choice depending on the microbiological, pharmacological, and toxicological properties.</p>
    <p>An example of a rational approach to the selection of an antibacterial is treatment of a urinary-tract infection in a patient complaining of nausea and symptoms of a urinary-tract infection in early pregnancy. The organism is reported as being resistant to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ampicillin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3330\">ampicillin</xref> but sensitive to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nitrofurantoin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3683\">nitrofurantoin</xref> (can cause nausea), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/gentamicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3478\">gentamicin</xref> (can be given only by injection and best avoided in pregnancy), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tetracycline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3439\">tetracycline</xref> (causes dental discoloration) and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/trimethoprim.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3586\">trimethoprim</xref> (folate antagonist therefore theoretical teratogenic risk), and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cefalexin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3376\">cefalexin</xref>. The safest antibiotics in pregnancy are the penicillins and cephalosporins; therefore, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cefalexin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3376\">cefalexin</xref> would be indicated for this patient.</p>
    <p>The principles involved in selection of an antibacterial must allow for a number of variables including changing renal and hepatic function, increasing bacterial resistance, and information on side-effects. Duration of therapy, dosage, and route of administration depend on site, type and severity of infection and response.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Antibacterial policies</p>
    <p>Local policies often limit the antibacterials that may be used to achieve reasonable economy consistent with adequate cover, and to reduce the development of resistant organisms. A policy may indicate a range of drugs for general use, and permit other drugs only on the advice of the microbiologist or physician responsible for the control of infectious diseases.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Before starting therapy</p>
    <p>The following precepts should be considered before starting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Viral infections should not be treated with antibacterials. However, antibacterials may be used to treat secondary bacterial infection (e.g. bacterial pneumonia secondary to influenza);</li>
      <li> Samples should be taken for culture and sensitivity testing; ‘<b>blind</b>’ antibacterial prescribing for unexplained pyrexia usually leads to further difficulty in establishing the diagnosis; </li>
      <li>Knowledge of <b>prevalent organisms</b> and their current sensitivity is of great help in choosing an antibacterial before bacteriological confirmation is available. Generally, narrow-spectrum antibacterials are preferred to broad-spectrum antibacterials unless there is a clear clinical indication (e.g. life-threatening sepsis);</li>
      <li>The <b>dose</b> of an antibacterial varies according to a number of factors including age, weight, hepatic function, renal function, and severity of infection. The prescribing of the so-called ‘standard’ dose in serious infections may result in failure of treatment or even death of the patient; therefore it is important to prescribe a dose appropriate to the condition. An inadequate dose may also increase the likelihood of antibacterial resistance. On the other hand, for an antibacterial with a narrow margin between the toxic and therapeutic dose (e.g. an aminoglycoside) it is also important to avoid an excessive dose and the concentration of the drug in the plasma may need to be monitored;</li>
      <li>The <b>route</b> of administration of an antibacterial often depends on the severity of the infection. Life-threatening infections require intravenous therapy. Antibacterials that are well absorbed may be given by mouth even for some serious infections. Parenteral administration is also appropriate when the oral route cannot be used (e.g. because of vomiting) or if absorption is inadequate. Whenever possible, painful intramuscular injections should be avoided in children;</li>
      <li>
        <b>Duration</b> of therapy depends on the nature of the infection and the response to treatment. Courses should not be unduly prolonged because they encourage resistance, they may lead to side-effects and they are costly. However, in certain infections such as tuberculosis or osteomyelitis it may be necessary to treat for prolonged periods. Conversely a single dose of an antibacterial may cure uncomplicated urinary-tract infections. The prescription for an antibacterial should specify the duration of treatment or the date when treatment is to be reviewed.</li>
    </ul>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Superinfection</p>
    <p>In general, broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs such as the cephalosporins are more likely to be associated with adverse reactions related to the selection of resistant organisms e.g. <i>fungal infections</i> or <i>antibiotic-associated colitis</i> (pseudomembranous colitis); other problems associated with superinfection include vaginitis and pruritus ani.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Therapy</p>
    <p>When the pathogen has been isolated treatment may be changed to a more appropriate antibacterial if necessary. If no bacterium is cultured the antibacterial can be continued or stopped on clinical grounds.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Notifiable diseases</p>
    <p>Doctors must notify the Proper Officer of the local authority (usually the consultant in communicable disease control) when attending a patient suspected of suffering from any of the diseases listed below; a form is available from the Proper Officer.</p>

Before selecting an antibacterial the clinician must first consider two factors— the patient and the known or likely causative organism. Factors related to the patient which must be considered include history of allergy, renal and hepatic function, susceptibility to infection (i.e. whether immunocompromised), ability to tolerate drugs by mouth, severity of illness, ethnic origin, age, whether taking other medication and, if female, whether pregnant, breast-feeding or taking an oral contraceptive.

The known or likely organism and its antibacterial sensitivity, in association with the above factors, will suggest one or more antibacterials, the final choice depending on the microbiological, pharmacological, and toxicological properties.

An example of a rational approach to the selection of an antibacterial is treatment of a urinary-tract infection in a patient complaining of nausea and symptoms of a urinary-tract infection in early pregnancy. The organism is reported as being resistant to ampicillin but sensitive to nitrofurantoin (can cause nausea), gentamicin (can be given only by injection and best avoided in pregnancy), tetracycline (causes dental discoloration) and trimethoprim (folate antagonist therefore theoretical teratogenic risk), and cefalexin. The safest antibiotics in pregnancy are the penicillins and cephalosporins; therefore, cefalexin would be indicated for this patient.

The principles involved in selection of an antibacterial must allow for a number of variables including changing renal and hepatic function, increasing bacterial resistance, and information on side-effects. Duration of therapy, dosage, and route of administration depend on site, type and severity of infection and response.

Antibacterial policies

Local policies often limit the antibacterials that may be used to achieve reasonable economy consistent with adequate cover, and to reduce the development of resistant organisms. A policy may indicate a range of drugs for general use, and permit other drugs only on the advice of the microbiologist or physician responsible for the control of infectious diseases.

Before starting therapy

The following precepts should be considered before starting:

Viral infections should not be treated with antibacterials. However, antibacterials may be used to treat secondary bacterial infection (e.g. bacterial pneumonia secondary to influenza); Samples should be taken for culture and sensitivity testing; ‘blind’ antibacterial prescribing for unexplained pyrexia usually leads to further difficulty in establishing the diagnosis; Knowledge of prevalent organisms and their current sensitivity is of great help in choosing an antibacterial before bacteriological confirmation is available. Generally, narrow-spectrum antibacterials are preferred to broad-spectrum antibacterials unless there is a clear clinical indication (e.g. life-threatening sepsis);The dose of an antibacterial varies according to a number of factors including age, weight, hepatic function, renal function, and severity of infection. The prescribing of the so-called ‘standard’ dose in serious infections may result in failure of treatment or even death of the patient; therefore it is important to prescribe a dose appropriate to the condition. An inadequate dose may also increase the likelihood of antibacterial resistance. On the other hand, for an antibacterial with a narrow margin between the toxic and therapeutic dose (e.g. an aminoglycoside) it is also important to avoid an excessive dose and the concentration of the drug in the plasma may need to be monitored;The route of administration of an antibacterial often depends on the severity of the infection. Life-threatening infections require intravenous therapy. Antibacterials that are well absorbed may be given by mouth even for some serious infections. Parenteral administration is also appropriate when the oral route cannot be used (e.g. because of vomiting) or if absorption is inadequate. Whenever possible, painful intramuscular injections should be avoided in children;Duration of therapy depends on the nature of the infection and the response to treatment. Courses should not be unduly prolonged because they encourage resistance, they may lead to side-effects and they are costly. However, in certain infections such as tuberculosis or osteomyelitis it may be necessary to treat for prolonged periods. Conversely a single dose of an antibacterial may cure uncomplicated urinary-tract infections. The prescription for an antibacterial should specify the duration of treatment or the date when treatment is to be reviewed.Superinfection

In general, broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs such as the cephalosporins are more likely to be associated with adverse reactions related to the selection of resistant organisms e.g. fungal infections or antibiotic-associated colitis (pseudomembranous colitis); other problems associated with superinfection include vaginitis and pruritus ani.

Therapy

When the pathogen has been isolated treatment may be changed to a more appropriate antibacterial if necessary. If no bacterium is cultured the antibacterial can be continued or stopped on clinical grounds.

Notifiable diseases

Doctors must notify the Proper Officer of the local authority (usually the consultant in communicable disease control) when attending a patient suspected of suffering from any of the diseases listed below; a form is available from the Proper Officer.

      <p>Antibacterial prophylaxis and chlorhexidine mouthwash are <b>not</b> recommended for the prevention of endocarditis in patients undergoing dental procedures.</p>
      <p>Antibacterial prophylaxis is <b>not</b> recommended for the prevention of endocarditis in patients undergoing procedures of the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>upper and lower respiratory tract (including ear, nose, and throat procedures and bronchoscopy);</li>
        <li>genito-urinary tract (including urological, gynaecological, and obstetric procedures);</li>
        <li>upper and lower gastro-intestinal tract.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whilst these procedures can cause bacteraemia, there is no clear association with the development of infective endocarditis. Prophylaxis may expose patients to the adverse effects of antimicrobials when the evidence of benefit has not been proven.</p>
      <p>Any infection in patients at risk of endocarditis should be investigated promptly and treated appropriately to reduce the risk of endocarditis.</p>
      <p>If patients at risk of endocarditis are undergoing a gastro-intestinal or genito-urinary tract procedure at a site where infection is suspected, they should receive appropriate antibacterial therapy that includes cover against organisms that cause endocarditis.</p>
      <p>Patients at risk of endocarditis should be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>advised to maintain good oral hygiene;</li>
        <li>told how to recognise signs of infective endocarditis, and advised when to seek expert advice.</li>
      </ul>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p>Patients at risk of endocarditis include those with valve replacement, acquired valvular heart disease with stenosis or regurgitation, structural congenital heart disease (including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect, fully repaired patent ductus arteriosus, and closure devices considered to be endothelialised), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or a previous episode of infective endocarditis.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Joint prostheses and dental treatment</p>

Ciprofloxacinorrifampicinor i/m ceftriaxone [unlicensed indication].

For details of those who should receive chemoprophylaxis contact a consultant in communicable disease control (or a consultant in infectious diseases or the local Public Health England laboratory). Unless there has been direct exposure of the mouth or nose to infectious droplets from a patient with meningococcal disease who has received less than 24 hours of antibacterial treatment, healthcare workers do not generally require chemoprophylaxis.

Prevention of secondary case of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease

Rifampicinor (if rifampicin cannot be used) i/m or i/v ceftriaxone [unlicensed indication].

For details of those who should receive chemoprophylaxis contact a consultant in communicable disease control (or a consultant in infectious diseases or the local Public Health England laboratory). Unless there has been direct exposure of the mouth or nose to infectious droplets from a patient with meningococcal disease who has received less than 24 hours of antibacterial treatment, healthcare workers do not generally require chemoprophylaxis.

Within 4 weeks of illness onset in an index case with confirmed or suspected invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, give antibacterial prophylaxis to all household contacts if there is a vulnerable individual in the household. Also, give antibacterial prophylaxis to the index case if they are in contact with vulnerable household contacts or if they are under 10 years of age. Vulnerable individuals include the immunocompromised, those with asplenia, or children under 10 years of age. If there are 2 or more cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease within 120 days in a pre-school or primary school, antibacterial prophylaxis should also be given to all room contacts (including staff). Also see immunisation against Haemophilus influenzae type b disease.

Prevention of endocarditis

NICE guidance: Antimicrobial prophylaxis against infective endocarditis in adults and children undergoing interventional procedures (March 2008)

Antibacterial prophylaxis and chlorhexidine mouthwash are not recommended for the prevention of endocarditis in patients undergoing dental procedures.

Antibacterial prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of endocarditis in patients undergoing procedures of the:

upper and lower respiratory tract (including ear, nose, and throat procedures and bronchoscopy);genito-urinary tract (including urological, gynaecological, and obstetric procedures);upper and lower gastro-intestinal tract.Whilst these procedures can cause bacteraemia, there is no clear association with the development of infective endocarditis. Prophylaxis may expose patients to the adverse effects of antimicrobials when the evidence of benefit has not been proven.

Any infection in patients at risk of endocarditis should be investigated promptly and treated appropriately to reduce the risk of endocarditis.

If patients at risk of endocarditis are undergoing a gastro-intestinal or genito-urinary tract procedure at a site where infection is suspected, they should receive appropriate antibacterial therapy that includes cover against organisms that cause endocarditis.

Patients at risk of endocarditis should be:

advised to maintain good oral hygiene;told how to recognise signs of infective endocarditis, and advised when to seek expert advice.Patients at risk of endocarditis include those with valve replacement, acquired valvular heart disease with stenosis or regurgitation, structural congenital heart disease (including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect, fully repaired patent ductus arteriosus, and closure devices considered to be endothelialised), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or a previous episode of infective endocarditis.

Dermatological procedures

Advice of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy is that patients who undergo dermatological procedures do not require antibacterial prophylaxis against endocarditis.

The British Association of Dermatologists Therapy Guidelines and Audit Subcommittee advise that such dermatological procedures include skin biopsies and excision of moles or of malignant lesions.

Joint prostheses and dental treatment

Advice of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy is that patients with prosthetic joint implants (including total hip replacements) do not require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment. The Working Party considers that it is unacceptable to expose patients to the adverse effects of antibiotics when there is no evidence that such prophylaxis is of any benefit, but that those who develop any intercurrent infection require prompt treatment with antibiotics to which the infecting organisms are sensitive.

The Working Party has commented that joint infections have rarely been shown to follow dental procedures and are even more rarely caused by oral streptococci.

Immunosuppression and indwelling intraperitoneal catheters

Advice of a Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy is that patients who are immunosuppressed (including transplant patients) and patients with indwelling intraperitoneal catheters do not require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment provided there is no other indication for prophylaxis.

The Working Party has commented that there is little evidence that dental treatment is followed by infection in immunosuppressed and immunodeficient patients nor is there evidence that dental treatment is followed by infection in patients with indwelling intraperitoneal catheters.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Antidepressant drugs are effective for treating moderate to severe depression associated with psychomotor and physiological changes such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance; improvement in sleep is usually the first benefit of therapy. Ideally, patients with moderate to severe depression should be treated with psychological therapy in addition to drug therapy. Antidepressant drugs are also effective for dysthymia (lower grade chronic depression (typically of at least 2 years duration)).</p>
    <p>Antidepressant drugs should not be used routinely in mild depression, and psychological therapy should be considered initially; however, a trial of antidepressant therapy may be considered in cases refractory to psychological treatments or in those associated with psychosocial or medical problems. Drug treatment of mild depression may also be considered in patients with a history of moderate or severe depression.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Choice</p>
      <p>The major classes of antidepressant drugs include the tricyclic and related antidepressants, the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). A number of antidepressant drugs cannot be accommodated easily into this classification.</p>
      <p>There is little to choose between the different classes of antidepressant drugs in terms of efficacy, so choice should be based on the individual patient’s requirements, including the presence of concomitant disease, existing therapy, suicide risk, and previous response to antidepressant therapy. Since there may be an interval of 2 weeks before the antidepressant action takes place, electroconvulsive treatment may be required in severe depression when delay is hazardous or intolerable. During the first few weeks of treatment, there is an increased potential for agitation, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.</p>
      <p>SSRIs are better tolerated and are safer in overdose than other classes of antidepressants and should be considered first-line for treating depression. In patients with unstable angina or who have had a recent myocardial infarction, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sertraline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2435\">sertraline</xref> has been shown to be safe.</p>
      <p>Tricyclic antidepressants have similar efficacy to SSRIs but are more likely to be discontinued because of side-effects; toxicity in overdosage is also a problem. SSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
      <p>MAOIs have dangerous interactions with some foods and drugs, and should be reserved for use by specialists.</p>
      <p>Although anxiety is often present in depressive illness (and may be the presenting symptom), the use of an antipsychotic or an anxiolytic may mask the true diagnosis. Anxiolytics or antipsychotic drugs should therefore be used with caution in depression but they are useful adjuncts in agitated patients. Augmenting antidepressants with antipsychotics under specialist supervision may also be necessary in patients who have depression with psychotic symptoms.</p>
      <p>
        <b>St John’s wort</b> (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>) is a popular herbal remedy on sale to the public for treating mild depression. It should not be prescribed or recommended for depression because St John’s wort can induce drug metabolising enzymes and a number of important interactions with conventional drugs, including conventional antidepressants, have been identified. Furthermore, the amount of active ingredient varies between different preparations of St John’s wort and switching from one to another can change the degree of enzyme induction. If a patient stops taking St John’s wort, the concentration of interacting drugs may increase, leading to toxicity.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management </p>
      <p>Patients should be reviewed every 1–2 weeks at the start of antidepressant treatment. Treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks in the elderly) before considering whether to switch antidepressant due to lack of efficacy. In cases of partial response, continue for a further 2–4 weeks (elderly patients may take longer to respond).</p>
      <p>Following remission, antidepressant treatment should be continued at the same dose for at least 6 months (about 12 months in the elderly), or for at least 12 months in patients receiving treatment for generalised anxiety disorder (as the likelihood of relapse is high). Patients with a history of recurrent depression should receive maintenance treatment for at least 2 years.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Hyponatraemia and antidepressant therapy</p>
      <p>Hyponatraemia (usually in the elderly and possibly due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone) has been associated with all types of antidepressants; however, it has been reported more frequently with SSRIs than with other antidepressants. Hyponatraemia should be considered in all patients who develop drowsiness, confusion, or convulsions while taking an antidepressant.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Suicidal behaviour and antidepressant therapy</p>
      <p>The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children, young adults, and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm, or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Serotonin syndrome</p>
      <p>Serotonin syndrome or serotonin toxicity is a relatively uncommon adverse drug reaction caused by excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. Onset of symptoms, which range from mild to lifethreatening, can occur within hours or days following the initiation, dose escalation, or overdose of a serotonergic drug, the addition of a new serotonergic drug, or the replacement of one serotonergic drug by another without allowing a long enough washout period in-between, particularly when the first drug is an irreversible MAOI or a drug with a long half-life. Severe toxicity, which is a medical emergency, usually occurs with a combination of serotonergic drugs, one of which is generally an MAOI.</p>
      <p>The characteristic symptoms of serotonin syndrome fall into 3 main areas, although features from each group may not be seen in all patients—neuromuscular hyperactivity (such as tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, myoclonus, rigidity), autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, blood pressure changes, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, diarrhoea), and altered mental state (agitation, confusion, mania).</p>
      <p>Treatment consists of withdrawal of the serotonergic medication and supportive care; specialist advice should be sought.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Failure to respond</p>
      <p>Failure to respond to initial treatment with an SSRI may require an increase in the dose, or switching to a different SSRI or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mirtazapine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2449\">mirtazapine</xref>.

      <p>Tricyclic and related antidepressants block the re-uptake of both serotonin and noradrenaline, although to different extents.

Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs can be roughly divided into those with additional sedative properties and those that are less sedating.

      <p>About 10 to 20% of patients fail to respond to tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs and inadequate dosage may account for some of these failures. It is important to use doses that are sufficiently high for effective treatment but not so high as to cause toxic effects. Low doses should be used for initial treatment in the <b>elderly</b>.

Antidepressant drugs are effective for treating moderate to severe depression associated with psychomotor and physiological changes such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance; improvement in sleep is usually the first benefit of therapy. Ideally, patients with moderate to severe depression should be treated with psychological therapy in addition to drug therapy. Antidepressant drugs are also effective for dysthymia (lower grade chronic depression (typically of at least 2 years duration)).

Antidepressant drugs should not be used routinely in mild depression, and psychological therapy should be considered initially; however, a trial of antidepressant therapy may be considered in cases refractory to psychological treatments or in those associated with psychosocial or medical problems. Drug treatment of mild depression may also be considered in patients with a history of moderate or severe depression.

Choice

The major classes of antidepressant drugs include the tricyclic and related antidepressants, the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). A number of antidepressant drugs cannot be accommodated easily into this classification.

There is little to choose between the different classes of antidepressant drugs in terms of efficacy, so choice should be based on the individual patient’s requirements, including the presence of concomitant disease, existing therapy, suicide risk, and previous response to antidepressant therapy. Since there may be an interval of 2 weeks before the antidepressant action takes place, electroconvulsive treatment may be required in severe depression when delay is hazardous or intolerable. During the first few weeks of treatment, there is an increased potential for agitation, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.

SSRIs are better tolerated and are safer in overdose than other classes of antidepressants and should be considered first-line for treating depression. In patients with unstable angina or who have had a recent myocardial infarction, sertraline has been shown to be safe.

Tricyclic antidepressants have similar efficacy to SSRIs but are more likely to be discontinued because of side-effects; toxicity in overdosage is also a problem. SSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants.

MAOIs have dangerous interactions with some foods and drugs, and should be reserved for use by specialists.

Although anxiety is often present in depressive illness (and may be the presenting symptom), the use of an antipsychotic or an anxiolytic may mask the true diagnosis. Anxiolytics or antipsychotic drugs should therefore be used with caution in depression but they are useful adjuncts in agitated patients. Augmenting antidepressants with antipsychotics under specialist supervision may also be necessary in patients who have depression with psychotic symptoms.

St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a popular herbal remedy on sale to the public for treating mild depression. It should not be prescribed or recommended for depression because St John’s wort can induce drug metabolising enzymes and a number of important interactions with conventional drugs, including conventional antidepressants, have been identified. Furthermore, the amount of active ingredient varies between different preparations of St John’s wort and switching from one to another can change the degree of enzyme induction. If a patient stops taking St John’s wort, the concentration of interacting drugs may increase, leading to toxicity.

Management 

Patients should be reviewed every 1–2 weeks at the start of antidepressant treatment. Treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks in the elderly) before considering whether to switch antidepressant due to lack of efficacy. In cases of partial response, continue for a further 2–4 weeks (elderly patients may take longer to respond).

Following remission, antidepressant treatment should be continued at the same dose for at least 6 months (about 12 months in the elderly), or for at least 12 months in patients receiving treatment for generalised anxiety disorder (as the likelihood of relapse is high). Patients with a history of recurrent depression should receive maintenance treatment for at least 2 years.

Hyponatraemia and antidepressant therapy

Hyponatraemia (usually in the elderly and possibly due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone) has been associated with all types of antidepressants; however, it has been reported more frequently with SSRIs than with other antidepressants. Hyponatraemia should be considered in all patients who develop drowsiness, confusion, or convulsions while taking an antidepressant.

Suicidal behaviour and antidepressant therapy

The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children, young adults, and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm, or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.

Serotonin syndrome

Serotonin syndrome or serotonin toxicity is a relatively uncommon adverse drug reaction caused by excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. Onset of symptoms, which range from mild to lifethreatening, can occur within hours or days following the initiation, dose escalation, or overdose of a serotonergic drug, the addition of a new serotonergic drug, or the replacement of one serotonergic drug by another without allowing a long enough washout period in-between, particularly when the first drug is an irreversible MAOI or a drug with a long half-life. Severe toxicity, which is a medical emergency, usually occurs with a combination of serotonergic drugs, one of which is generally an MAOI.

The characteristic symptoms of serotonin syndrome fall into 3 main areas, although features from each group may not be seen in all patients—neuromuscular hyperactivity (such as tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, myoclonus, rigidity), autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, blood pressure changes, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, diarrhoea), and altered mental state (agitation, confusion, mania).

Treatment consists of withdrawal of the serotonergic medication and supportive care; specialist advice should be sought.

Failure to respond

Failure to respond to initial treatment with an SSRI may require an increase in the dose, or switching to a different SSRI or mirtazapine. Other second-line choices include lofepramine, moclobemide, and reboxetine. Other tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine should be considered for more severe forms of depression; irreversible MAOIs should only be prescribed by specialists. Failure to respond to a second antidepressant may require the addition of another antidepressant of a different class, or use of an augmenting agent (such as lithium, aripiprazole [unlicensed], olanzapine [unlicensed], quetiapine, or risperidone [unlicensed]), but such adjunctive treatment should be initiated only by doctors with special experience of these combinations. Electroconvulsive therapy may be initiated in severe refractory depression.

Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder

Management of acute anxiety generally involves the use of a benzodiazepine or buspirone hydrochloride. For chronic anxiety (of longer than 4 weeks’ duration) it may be appropriate to use an antidepressant. Combined therapy with a benzodiazepine may be required until the antidepressant takes effect. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder, a form of chronic anxiety, should be offered psychological treatment before initiating an antidepressant. If drug treatment is needed, an SSRI such as escitalopram, paroxetine, or sertraline [unlicensed], can be used. Duloxetine and venlafaxine (serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) are also recommended for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder; if the patient cannot tolerate SSRIs or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (or if treatment has failed to control symptoms), pregabalin can be considered.

Panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobic states such as social anxiety disorder are treated with SSRIs. Clomipramine hydrochloride or imipramine hydrochloride can be used second-line in panic disorder [unlicensed]; clomipramine hydrochloride can also be used second-line for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Moclobemide is licensed for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.

Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs

Choice

Tricyclic and related antidepressants block the re-uptake of both serotonin and noradrenaline, although to different extents. For example, clomipramine hydrochloride is more selective for serotonergic transmission, and imipramine hydrochloride is more selective for noradrenergic transmission. Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs can be roughly divided into those with additional sedative properties and those that are less sedating. Agitated and anxious patients tend to respond best to the sedative compounds, whereas withdrawn and apathetic patients will often obtain most benefit from the less sedating ones. Those with sedative properties include amitriptyline hydrochloride, clomipramine hydrochloride, dosulepin hydrochloride, doxepin, mianserin hydrochloride, trazodone hydrochloride, and trimipramine. Those with less sedative properties include imipramine hydrochloride, lofepramine, and nortriptyline.

Tricyclic and related antidepressants also have varying degrees of antimuscarinic side-effects and cardiotoxicity in overdosage, which may be important in individual patients. Lofepramine has a lower incidence of side-effects and is less dangerous in overdosage but is infrequently associated with hepatic toxicity. Imipramine hydrochloride is also well established, but has more marked antimuscarinic side-effects than other tricyclic and related antidepressants. Amitriptyline hydrochloride and dosulepin hydrochloride are effective but they are particularly dangerous in overdosage and are not recommended for the treatment of depression; dosulepin hydrochloride should be initiated by a specialist.

Dosage

About 10 to 20% of patients fail to respond to tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs and inadequate dosage may account for some of these failures. It is important to use doses that are sufficiently high for effective treatment but not so high as to cause toxic effects. Low doses should be used for initial treatment in the elderly. In most patients the long half-life of tricyclic antidepressant drugs allows once-daily administration, usually at night; the use of modified-release preparations is therefore unnecessary.

Some tricyclic antidepressants are used in the management of panic and other anxiety disorders. Some tricyclic antidepressants may also have a role in some forms of neuralgia and in nocturnal enuresis in children.

Children and adolescents

Studies have shown that tricyclic antidepressants are not effective for treating depression in children.

Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors

Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors are used much less frequently than tricyclic and related antidepressants, or SSRIs and related antidepressants because of the dangers of dietary and drug interactions and the fact that it is easier to prescribe MAOIs when tricyclic antidepressants have been unsuccessful than vice versa.

Tranylcypromine has a greater stimulant action than phenelzine or isocarboxazid and is more likely to cause a hypertensive crisis. Isocarboxazid and phenelzine are more likely to cause hepatotoxicity than tranylcypromine.

Moclobemide should be reserved as a second line treatment.

Phobic patients and depressed patients with atypical, hypochondriacal, or hysterical features are said to respond best to MAOIs. However, MAOIs should be tried in any patients who are refractory to treatment with other antidepressants as there is occasionally a dramatic response. Response to treatment may be delayed for 3 weeks or more and may take an additional 1 or 2 weeks to become maximal.

Other antidepressant drugs

The thioxanthene flupentixol (Fluanxol ) has antidepressant properties when given by mouth in low doses. Flupentixol is also used for the treatment of psychoses.

The systemic treatment of common fungal infections is outlined below; specialist treatment is required in most forms of systemic or disseminated fungal infections. Local treatment is suitable for a number of fungal infections (genital, bladder, eye, ear, oropharynx, and skin).

Aspergillosis

Aspergillosis most commonly affects the respiratory tract but in severely immunocompromised patients, invasive forms can affect the heart, brain, and skin. Voriconazole is the treatment of choice for aspergillosis; liposomal amphotericin is an alternative first-line treatment when voriconazole cannot be used. Caspofungin, itraconazole, or posaconazole can be used in patients who are refractory to, or intolerant of voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin. Itraconazole is also used for the treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis or as an adjunct in the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [unlicensed indication].

Candidiasis

Many superficial candidal infections including infections of the skin are treated locally; widespread or intractable infection requires systemic antifungal treatment. Vaginal candidiasis may be treated with locally acting antifungals or with fluconazole given by mouth; for resistant organisms in adults, itraconazole can be given by mouth.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis generally responds to topical therapy; fluconazole is given by mouth for unresponsive infections; it is effective and is reliably absorbed. Itraconazole may be used for infections that do not respond to fluconazole. Topical therapy may not be adequate in immunocompromised patients and an oral triazole antifungal is preferred.

For invasive or disseminated candidiasis, an echinocandin can be used. Fluconazole is an alternative for Candida albicans infection in clinically stable patients who have not received an azole antifungal recently. Amphotericin is an alternative when an echinocandin or fluconazole cannot be used, however, amphotericin should be considered for the initial treatment of CNS candidiasis. Voriconazole can be used for infections caused by fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. when oral therapy is required, or in patients intolerant of amphotericin or an echinocandin. In refractory cases, flucytosine can be used with intravenous amphotericin.

Cryptococcosis

Cryptococcosis is uncommon but infection in the immunocompromised, especially in HIV-positive patients, can be life-threatening; cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of fungal meningitis. The treatment of choice in cryptococcal meningitis is amphotericin by intravenous infusion and flucytosine by intravenous infusion for 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole by mouth for 8 weeks or until cultures are negative. In cryptococcosis, fluconazole is sometimes given alone as an alternative in HIV-positive patients with mild, localised infections or in those who cannot tolerate amphotericin. Following successful treatment, fluconazole can be used for prophylaxis against relapse until immunity recovers.

Histoplasmosis

Histoplasmosis is rare in temperate climates; it can be life-threatening, particularly in HIV-infected persons. Itraconazole can be used for the treatment of immunocompetent patients with indolent non-meningeal infection, including chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. Amphotericin by intravenous infusion is used for the initial treatment of fulminant or severe infections, followed by a course of itraconazole by mouth. Following successful treatment, itraconazole can be used for prophylaxis against relapse until immunity recovers.

Skin and nail infections

Mild localised fungal infections of the skin (including tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis) respond to topical therapy. Systemic therapy is appropriate if topical therapy fails, if many areas are affected, or if the site of infection is difficult to treat such as in infections of the nails (onychomycosis) and of the scalp (tinea capitis). Oral imidazole or triazole antifungals (particularly itraconazole) and terbinafine are used more frequently than griseofulvin because they have a broader spectrum of activity and require a shorter duration of treatment.

Tinea capitis is treated systemically; additional topical application of an antifungal may reduce transmission. Griseofulvin is used for tinea capitis in adults and children; it is effective against infections caused by Trichophyton tonsurans and Microsporum spp. Terbinafine is used for tinea capitis caused by T. tonsurans [unlicensed indication]. The role of terbinafine in the management of Microsporum infections is uncertain.

Pityriasis versicolor may be treated with itraconazole by mouth if topical therapy is ineffective; fluconazole by mouth is an alternative. Oral terbinafine is not effective for pityriasis versicolor.

Antifungal treatment may not be necessary in asymptomatic patients with tinea infection of the nails. If treatment is necessary, a systemic antifungal is more effective than topical therapy. Terbinafine and itraconazole have largely replaced griseofulvin for the systemic treatment of onychomycosis, particularly of the toenail; terbinafine is considered to be the drug of choice. Itraconazole can be administered as intermittent ‘pulse’ therapy. Topical antifungals also have a role in the treatment of onychomycosis.

Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients are at particular risk of fungal infections and may receive antifungal drugs prophylactically; oral triazole antifungals are the drugs of choice for prophylaxis. Fluconazole is more reliably absorbed than itraconazole, but fluconazole is not effective against Aspergillus spp. Itraconazole is preferred in patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis. Posaconazole can be used for prophylaxis in patients who are undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, if they are intolerant of fluconazole or itraconazole. Micafungin can be used for prophylaxis of candidiasis in patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation when fluconazole, itraconazole or posaconazole cannot be used.

Amphotericin by intravenous infusion or caspofungin is used for the empirical treatment of serious fungal infections; caspofungin is not effective against fungal infections of the CNS.

Triazole antifungals

Triazole antifungal drugs have a role in the prevention and systemic treatment of fungal infections.

Fluconazole is very well absorbed after oral administration. It also achieves good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid to treat fungal meningitis. Fluconazole is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and can be used to treat candiduria.

Itraconazole is active against a wide range of dermatophytes. Itraconazole capsules require an acid environment in the stomach for optimal absorption. Itraconazole has been associated with liver damage and should be avoided or used with caution in patients with liver disease; fluconazole is less frequently associated with hepatotoxicity.

Posaconazole is licensed for the treatment of invasive fungal infections unresponsive to conventional treatment.

Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal drug which is licensed for use in life-threatening infections.

Imidazole antifungals 

The imidazole antifungals include clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, ketoconazole, and tioconazole. They are used for the local treatment of vaginal candidiasis and for dermatophyte infections. Miconazole can be used locally for oral infections; it is also effective in intestinal infections. Systemic absorption may follow use of miconazole oral gel and may result in significant drug interactions.

Polyene antifungals

The polyene antifungals include amphotericin and nystatin; neither drug is absorbed when given by mouth. Nystatin is used for oral, oropharyngeal, and perioral infections by local application in the mouth. Nystatin is also used for Candida albicans infection of the skin.

Amphotericin by intravenous infusion is used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections and is active against most fungi and yeasts. It is highly protein bound and penetrates poorly into body fluids and tissues. When given parenterally amphotericin is toxic and side-effects are common. Lipid formulations of amphotericin (Abelcet and AmBisome) are significantly less toxic and are recommended when the conventional formulation of amphotericin is contra-indicated because of toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity or when response to conventional amphotericin is inadequate; lipid formulations are more expensive.

Echinocandin antifungals

The echinocandin antifungals include anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin. They are only active against Aspergillus spp. and Candida  spp.; however, anidulafungin and micafungin are not used for the treatment of aspergillosis. Echinocandins are not effective against fungal infections of the CNS.

Other antifungals

Flucytosine is used with amphotericin in a synergistic combination. Bone marrow depression can occur which limits its use, particularly in HIV-positive patients; weekly blood counts are necessary during prolonged therapy. Resistance to flucytosine can develop during therapy and sensitivity testing is essential before and during treatment. Flucytosine has a role in the treatment of systemic candidiasis and cryptococcal meningitis.

Griseofulvin is effective for widespread or intractable dermatophyte infections but has been superseded by newer antifungals, particularly for nail infections. It is the drug of choice for trichophyton infections in children. Duration of therapy is dependent on the site of the infection and may extend to a number of months.

Terbinafine is the drug of choice for fungal nail infections and is also used for ringworm infections where oral treatment is considered appropriate.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Antihistamines</p>
    <p>All antihistamines are of potential value in the treatment of nasal allergies, particularly seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever), and they may be of some value in vasomotor rhinitis. They reduce rhinorrhoea and sneezing but are usually less effective for nasal congestion. Antihistamines are used topically in the eye, in the nose, and on the skin.</p>
    <p>Oral antihistamines are also of some value in preventing urticaria and are used to treat urticarial rashes, pruritus, and insect bites and stings; they are also used in drug allergies. Injections of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlorphenamine-maleate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1934\">chlorphenamine maleate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/promethazine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1950\">promethazine hydrochloride</xref> are used as an adjunct to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref> in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis and angioedema. Antihistamines (including <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cinnarizine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2515\">cinnarizine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cyclizine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2522\">cyclizine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/promethazine-teoclate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2527\">promethazine teoclate</xref>) may also have a role in nausea and vomiting. Buclizine is included as an anti-emetic in a preparation for migraine. Antihistamines may also have a role in occasional insomnia.</p>
    <p>All older antihistamines cause sedation but <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/alimemazine-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1930\">alimemazine tartrate</xref> and <b>promethazine</b> may be more sedating whereas <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlorphenamine-maleate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1934\">chlorphenamine maleate</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cyclizine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2522\">cyclizine</xref> may be less so. This sedating activity is sometimes used to manage the pruritus associated with some allergies. There is little evidence that any one of the older, 'sedating' antihistamines is superior to another and patients vary widely in their response.</p>
    <p>Non-sedating antihistamines such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/acrivastine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1907\">acrivastine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bilastine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1909\">bilastine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cetirizine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1911\">cetirizine hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/desloratadine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1913\">desloratadine</xref> (an active metabolite of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/loratadine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1921\">loratadine</xref>), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fexofenadine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1915\">fexofenadine hydrochloride</xref> (an active metabolite of terfenadine), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/levocetirizine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1918\">levocetirizine hydrochloride</xref> (an isomer of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cetirizine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1911\">cetirizine hydrochloride</xref>), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/loratadine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1921\">loratadine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mizolastine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1923\">mizolastine</xref> cause less sedation and psychomotor impairment than the older antihistamines because they penetrate the blood brain barrier only to a slight extent.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Allergen immunotherapy</p>
    <p>Immunotherapy using allergen vaccines containing house dust mite, animal dander (cat or dog), or extracts of grass and tree pollen can reduce symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. A vaccine containing extracts of wasp and bee venom is used to reduce the risk of severe anaphylaxis and systemic reactions in individuals with hypersensitivity to wasp and bee stings. An oral preparation of grass pollen extract (<i>Grazax</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) is also licensed for disease-modifying treatment of grass pollen-induced rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Those requiring immunotherapy must be referred to a hospital specialist for accurate diagnosis, assessment, and treatment.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Anaphylaxis</p>
      <p>Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction. It is characterised by the rapid onset of respiratory and/or circulatory problems and is usually associated with skin and mucosal changes; prompt treatment is required. Patients with pre-existing asthma, especially poorly controlled asthma, are at particular risk of life-threatening reactions. Insect stings are a recognised risk (in particular wasp and bee stings). Latex and certain foods, including eggs, fish, cow’s milk protein, peanuts, sesame, shellfish, soy, and tree nuts may also precipitate anaphylaxis. Medicinal products particularly associated with anaphylaxis include blood products, vaccines, hyposensitising (allergen) preparations, antibacterials, aspirin and other NSAIDs, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. In the case of drugs, anaphylaxis is more likely after parenteral administration; resuscitation facilities must always be available for injections associated with special risk. Anaphylactic reactions may also be associated with <i>additives and excipients</i> in foods and medicines. Refined arachis (peanut) oil, which may be present in some medicinal products, is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction—nevertheless it is wise to check the full formula of preparations which may contain allergens.</p>

        <p>First-line treatment includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>securing the airway, restoration of blood pressure (laying the patient flat and raising the legs, or in the recovery position if unconscious or nauseous and at risk of vomiting);</li>
          <li>administering <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref> (by <b>intramuscular</b> injection in a dose of 500 micrograms (a dose of 300 micrograms may be appropriate for <i>immediate self-administration)</i>; the dose should be repeated if necessary at 5-minute intervals according to blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory function. Patients receiving beta-blockers require special consideration;</li>
          <li>administering high-flow <b>oxygen</b> and <b>intravenous fluids</b> is also of primary importance;</li>
          <li>administering an antihistamine, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlorphenamine-maleate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1934\">chlorphenamine maleate</xref>, by slow intravenous injection or intramuscular injection is a useful adjunctive treatment, given after adrenaline.</li>
          <li>Administering an intravenous corticosteroid such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydrocortisone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP515\">hydrocortisone</xref> (preferably as sodium succinate) is of secondary value in the initial management of anaphylaxis because the onset of action is delayed for several hours, but should be given to prevent further deterioration in severely affected patients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>Continuing respiratory deterioration</i> requires further treatment with <b>bronchodilators</b> including inhaled or intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/salbutamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1756\">salbutamol</xref>, inhaled <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ipratropium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1791\">ipratropium bromide</xref>, intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aminophylline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1811\">aminophylline</xref>, or intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/magnesium-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6120\">magnesium sulfate</xref> [unlicensed indication] (as for acute severe asthma); in addition to oxygen, assisted respiration and possibly emergency tracheotomy may be necessary.</p>
        <p>When a patient is so ill that there is doubt about the adequacy of the circulation, the initial injection of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref> may need to be given as a <i>dilute solution by the intravenous route</i>.</p>
        <p>Cardiopulmonary arrest may follow an anaphylactic reaction; resuscitation should be started immediately.</p>
        <p>On discharge, patients should be considered for further treatment with an oral antihistamine and an oral corticosteroid for up to 3 days to reduce the risk of further reaction. Patients should be instructed to return to hospital if symptoms recur and to contact their general practitioner for follow-up.</p>
        <p>Patients who are suspected of having had an anaphylactic reaction should be referred to a specialist for specific allergy diagnosis. Avoidance of the allergen is the principal treatment; if appropriate, an <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref> auto-injector should be given for self-administration or a replacement supplied.</p>

All antihistamines are of potential value in the treatment of nasal allergies, particularly seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever), and they may be of some value in vasomotor rhinitis. They reduce rhinorrhoea and sneezing but are usually less effective for nasal congestion. Antihistamines are used topically in the eye, in the nose, and on the skin.

Oral antihistamines are also of some value in preventing urticaria and are used to treat urticarial rashes, pruritus, and insect bites and stings; they are also used in drug allergies. Injections of chlorphenamine maleate or promethazine hydrochloride are used as an adjunct to adrenaline/epinephrine in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis and angioedema. Antihistamines (including cinnarizine, cyclizine, and promethazine teoclate) may also have a role in nausea and vomiting. Buclizine is included as an anti-emetic in a preparation for migraine. Antihistamines may also have a role in occasional insomnia.

All older antihistamines cause sedation but alimemazine tartrate and promethazine may be more sedating whereas chlorphenamine maleate and cyclizine may be less so. This sedating activity is sometimes used to manage the pruritus associated with some allergies. There is little evidence that any one of the older, 'sedating' antihistamines is superior to another and patients vary widely in their response.

Non-sedating antihistamines such as acrivastine, bilastine, cetirizine hydrochloride, desloratadine (an active metabolite of loratadine), fexofenadine hydrochloride (an active metabolite of terfenadine), levocetirizine hydrochloride (an isomer of cetirizine hydrochloride), loratadine, and mizolastine cause less sedation and psychomotor impairment than the older antihistamines because they penetrate the blood brain barrier only to a slight extent.

Allergen immunotherapy

Immunotherapy using allergen vaccines containing house dust mite, animal dander (cat or dog), or extracts of grass and tree pollen can reduce symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. A vaccine containing extracts of wasp and bee venom is used to reduce the risk of severe anaphylaxis and systemic reactions in individuals with hypersensitivity to wasp and bee stings. An oral preparation of grass pollen extract (Grazax) is also licensed for disease-modifying treatment of grass pollen-induced rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Those requiring immunotherapy must be referred to a hospital specialist for accurate diagnosis, assessment, and treatment.

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE). It is used as additional therapy in individuals with proven IgE-mediated sensitivity to inhaled allergens, whose severe persistent allergic asthma cannot be controlled adequately with high dose inhaled corticosteroid together with a long-acting beta2 agonist. Omalizumab should be initiated by physicians in specialist centres experienced in the treatment of severe persistent asthma. Omalizumab is also indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in patients who have had an inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment.

Allergic emergencies

Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction. It is characterised by the rapid onset of respiratory and/or circulatory problems and is usually associated with skin and mucosal changes; prompt treatment is required. Patients with pre-existing asthma, especially poorly controlled asthma, are at particular risk of life-threatening reactions. Insect stings are a recognised risk (in particular wasp and bee stings). Latex and certain foods, including eggs, fish, cow’s milk protein, peanuts, sesame, shellfish, soy, and tree nuts may also precipitate anaphylaxis. Medicinal products particularly associated with anaphylaxis include blood products, vaccines, hyposensitising (allergen) preparations, antibacterials, aspirin and other NSAIDs, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. In the case of drugs, anaphylaxis is more likely after parenteral administration; resuscitation facilities must always be available for injections associated with special risk. Anaphylactic reactions may also be associated with additives and excipients in foods and medicines. Refined arachis (peanut) oil, which may be present in some medicinal products, is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction—nevertheless it is wise to check the full formula of preparations which may contain allergens.

Treatment of anaphylaxis

Adrenaline/epinephrine provides physiological reversal of the immediate symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema.

First-line treatment includes:

securing the airway, restoration of blood pressure (laying the patient flat and raising the legs, or in the recovery position if unconscious or nauseous and at risk of vomiting);administering adrenaline/epinephrine (by intramuscular injection in a dose of 500 micrograms (a dose of 300 micrograms may be appropriate for immediate self-administration); the dose should be repeated if necessary at 5-minute intervals according to blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory function. Patients receiving beta-blockers require special consideration;administering high-flow oxygen and intravenous fluids is also of primary importance;administering an antihistamine, such as chlorphenamine maleate, by slow intravenous injection or intramuscular injection is a useful adjunctive treatment, given after adrenaline.Administering an intravenous corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone (preferably as sodium succinate) is of secondary value in the initial management of anaphylaxis because the onset of action is delayed for several hours, but should be given to prevent further deterioration in severely affected patients.Continuing respiratory deterioration requires further treatment with bronchodilators including inhaled or intravenous salbutamol, inhaled ipratropium bromide, intravenous aminophylline, or intravenous magnesium sulfate [unlicensed indication] (as for acute severe asthma); in addition to oxygen, assisted respiration and possibly emergency tracheotomy may be necessary.

When a patient is so ill that there is doubt about the adequacy of the circulation, the initial injection of adrenaline/epinephrine may need to be given as a dilute solution by the intravenous route.

Cardiopulmonary arrest may follow an anaphylactic reaction; resuscitation should be started immediately.

On discharge, patients should be considered for further treatment with an oral antihistamine and an oral corticosteroid for up to 3 days to reduce the risk of further reaction. Patients should be instructed to return to hospital if symptoms recur and to contact their general practitioner for follow-up.

Patients who are suspected of having had an anaphylactic reaction should be referred to a specialist for specific allergy diagnosis. Avoidance of the allergen is the principal treatment; if appropriate, an adrenaline/epinephrine auto-injector should be given for self-administration or a replacement supplied.

Intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine)

The intramuscular route  is the first choice route for the administration of adrenaline/epinephrine in the management of anaphylaxis. Adrenaline/epinephrine is best given as an intramuscular injection into the anterolateral aspect of the middle third of the thigh; it has a rapid onset of action after intramuscular administration and in the shocked patient its absorption from the intramuscular site is faster and more reliable than from the subcutaneous site.

Patients with severe allergy should be instructed in the self-administration of adrenaline/epinephrine by intramuscular injection.

Prompt injection of adrenaline/epinephrine is of paramount importance. The adrenaline/epinephrine doses recommended for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis by appropriately trained healthcare professionals are based on the revised recommendations of the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (UK).

Intravenous adrenaline (epinephrine)

Intravenous adrenaline/epinephrine should be given only by those experienced in its use, in a setting where patients can be carefully monitored.

When the patient is severely ill and there is real doubt about the adequacy of the circulation and absorption after intramuscular injection, adrenaline/epinephrine can be given by slowintravenous injection repeated according to response; if multiple doses are required, adrenaline/epinephrine should be given as a slow intravenous infusion stopping when a response has been obtained.

It is important that, where intramuscular injection might still succeed, time should not be wasted seeking intravenous access.

The intravenous route is also used for cardiac resuscitation.

Angioedema

Angioedema is dangerous if laryngeal oedema is present. In this circumstance adrenaline/epinephrine injection and oxygen should be given as described under Anaphylaxis; antihistamines and corticosteroids should also be given. Tracheal intubation may be necessary.

Hereditary angioedema

The treatment of hereditary angioedema should be under specialist supervision. Unlike allergic angioedema, adrenaline/epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines should not be used for the treatment of acute attacks, including attacks involving laryngeal oedema, as they are ineffective and may delay appropriate treatment—intubation may be necessary. The administration of C1-esterase inhibitor, an endogenous complement blocker derived from human plasma, (in fresh frozen plasma or in partially purified form) can terminate acute attacks of hereditary angioedema; it can also be used for short-term prophylaxis before dental, medical or surgical procedures. Conestat alfa and icatibant are licensed for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema in adults with C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency.

Tranexamic acid and danazol [unlicensed indication] are used for short-term and long-term prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema. Short-term prophylaxis with tranexamic acid or danazol is started several days before planned procedures (e.g. dental work) and continued for 2–5 days afterwards. Danazol should be avoided in children because of its androgenic effects.

Vasodilators have a potent hypotensive effect, especially when used in combination with a beta-blocker and a thiazide. Important: see Hypertension (hypertensive crises) for a warning on the hazards of a very rapid fall in blood pressure.

Hydralazine hydrochloride is given by mouth as an adjunct to other antihypertensives for the treatment of resistant hypertension but is rarely used; when used alone it causes tachycardia and fluid retention.

Sodium nitroprusside [unlicensed] is given by intravenous infusion to control severe hypertensive emergencies when parenteral treatment is necessary.

Minoxidil should be reserved for the treatment of severe hypertension resistant to other drugs. Vasodilatation is accompanied by increased cardiac output and tachycardia and the patients develop fluid retention. For this reason the addition of a beta-blocker and a diuretic (usually furosemide, in high dosage) are mandatory. Hypertrichosis is troublesome and renders this drug unsuitable for females.

Prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin have alpha-blocking and vasodilator properties.

Ambrisentan, bosentan, iloprost, macitentan, sildenafil, and tadalafil are licensed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and should be used under specialist supervision. Epoprostenol can be used in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension resistant to other treatments. Bosentan is also licensed to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease. Riociguat is licensed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; it should be used under specialist supervision.

Sitaxentan has been withdrawn from the market because the benefit of treatment does not outweigh the risk of severe hepatotoxicity.

Centrally acting antihypertensive drugs

Methyldopa is a centrally acting antihypertensive; it may be used for the management of hypertension in pregnancy.

Clonidine hydrochloride has the disadvantage that sudden withdrawal of treatment may cause severe rebound hypertension.

Moxonidine, a centrally acting drug, is licensed for mild to moderate essential hypertension. It may have a role when thiazides, calcium-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers are not appropriate or have failed to control blood pressure.

Adrenergic neurone blocking drugs

Adrenergic neurone blocking drugs prevent the release of noradrenaline from postganglionic adrenergic neurones. These drugs do not control supine blood pressure and may cause postural hypotension. For this reason they have largely fallen from use, but may be necessary with other therapy in resistant hypertension.

Guanethidine monosulfate, which also depletes the nerve endings of noradrenaline, is licensed for rapid control of blood pressure, however alternative treatments are preferred.

Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs

Prazosin has post-synaptic alpha-blocking and vasodilator properties and rarely causes tachycardia. It may, however, reduce blood pressure rapidly after the first dose and should be introduced with caution. Doxazosin, indoramin, and terazosin have properties similar to those of prazosin.

Alpha-blockers can be used with other antihypertensive drugs in the treatment of resistant hypertension.

Prostatic hyperplasia

Alfuzosin hydrochloride, doxazosin, indoramin, prazosin, tamsulosin hydrochloride, and terazosin are indicated for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Artemether with lumefantrine is licensed for thetreatment of acute non-complicated falciparum malaria.

Chloroquine

Chloroquine is used for the prophylaxis of malaria in areas of the world where the risk of chloroquine-resistantfalciparum malaria is still low. It is also used with proguanil hydrochloride when chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria is present but this regimen may not give optimal protection (see recommended regimens for prophylaxis against malaria in Malaria, prophylaxis).

Chloroquine is no longer recommended for the treatment of falciparum malaria owing to widespread resistance, nor is it recommended if the infective species is not known or if the infection is mixed; in these cases treatment should be with quinine, Malarone, or Riamet. It is still recommended for the treatment of non-falciparum malaria.

Mefloquine

Mefloquine is used for the prophylaxis of malaria in areas of the world where there is a high risk of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria (for details, see recommended regimens for prophylaxis against malaria in Malaria, prophylaxis).

Mefloquine is now rarely used for the treatment of falciparum malaria because of increased resistance. It is rarely used for the treatment of non-falciparum malaria because better tolerated alternatives are available. Mefloquine should not be used for treatment if it has been used for prophylaxis.

Piperaquine with artenimol

Artenimol with piperaquine phosphate is not recommended for the first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria because there is limited experience of its use in travellers who usually reside in areas where malaria is not endemic. Piperaquine has a long half-life.

Primaquine

Primaquine is used to eliminate the liver stages of P. vivax or P. ovale following chloroquine treatment.

Proguanil

Proguanil hydrochloride is used (usually with chloroquine, but occasionally alone) for the prophylaxis of malaria, (for details, see Recommended regimens for prophylaxis against malaria).

Proguanil hydrochloride used alone is not suitable for the treatment of malaria; however, Malarone (a combination of atovaquone with proguanil hydrochloride) is licensed for the treatment of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Malarone is also used for the prophylaxis of falciparum malaria in areas of widespread mefloquine or chloroquine resistance. Malarone is also used as an alternative to mefloquine or doxycycline. Malarone is particularly suitable for short trips to highly chloroquine-resistant areas because it needs to be taken only for 7 days after leaving an endemic area.

Pyrimethamine

Pyrimethamine should not be used alone, but is used with sulfadoxine.

Pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine is not recommended for the prophylaxis of malaria, but can be used in the treatment of falciparum malaria with (or following) quinine.

Quinine

Quinine is not suitable for the prophylaxis of malaria.

Quinine is used for the treatment of falciparum malaria or if the infective species is not known or if the infection is mixed (for details see Malaria, treatment).

Tetracyclines

Doxycycline is used in adults and children over 12 years for the prophylaxis of malaria in areas of widespread mefloquine or chloroquine resistance. Doxycycline is also used as an alternative to mefloquine or Malarone (for details, see Recommended regimens for prophylaxis against malaria).

Antiplatelet drugs decrease platelet aggregation and inhibit thrombus formation in the arterial circulation, because in faster-flowing vessels, thrombi are composed mainly of platelets with little fibrin.

Use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular events, in patients with or without diabetes, is of unproven benefit. Long-term use of aspirin is of benefit in established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention); unduly high blood pressure must be controlled before aspirin is given. If the patient is at a high risk of gastro-intestinal bleeding, a proton pump inhibitor can be added.

Aspirin is given following coronary bypass surgery. It is also used in atrial fibrillation, for intermittent claudication, for stable angina and acute coronary syndromes, for use following placement of coronary stents and for use in stroke.

Clopidogrel is licensed for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with a history of symptomatic ischaemic disease. Clopidogrel, in combination with low-dose aspirin, is also licensed for acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation; in these circumstances the combination is given for up to 12 months (most benefit occurs during the first 3 months; there is no evidence of benefit beyond 12 months). Clopidogrel, in combination with low-dose aspirin, is also licensed for acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation; the combination is licensed for at least 4 weeks, but the optimum treatment duration has not been established. In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, clopidogrel is used as an adjunct with aspirin. Patients who are not already taking clopidogrel should receive a loading dose prior to procedure.

Clopidogrel is also licensed, in combination with low-dose aspirin, for the prevention of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (and at least one risk factor for a vascular event), and for whom warfarin sodium is unsuitable.

Use of clopidogrel with aspirin increases the risk of bleeding. Clopidogrel monotherapy may be an alternative when aspirin is contra-indicated, for example in those with aspirin hypersensitivity, or when aspirin is not tolerated despite the addition of a proton pump inhibitor (see also NICE guidance).

Clopidogrel also has uses in stroke.

Dipyridamoleis used by mouth as an adjunct to oral anticoagulation for prophylaxis of thromboembolism associated with prosthetic heart valves. Modified-release preparations are licensed for secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attacks.

Prasugrel, in combination with aspirin, is licensed for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention; the combination is usually given for up to 12 months.

Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is licensed for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome; the combination is usually given for up to 12 months.

Cangrelor, in combination with aspirin, is licensed for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not received treatment with oral clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor prior to the procedure and in whom oral therapy with these drugs is not suitable. Cangrelor is to be used under expert supervision only.

Antiplatelet drugs and coronary stents

Patients selected for percutaneous coronary intervention, with the placement of a coronary stent, will require dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and either cangrelor, clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor. Aspirin therapy should continue indefinitely. Clopidogrel is recommended for 1 month following elective percutaneous coronary intervention with placement of a bare-metal stent, and for 12 months if percutaneous coronary intervention with placement of a bare-metal stent was for an acute coronary syndrome; clopidogrel should be given for 12 months following placement of a drug-eluting stent. Clopidogrel should not be discontinued prematurely in patients with a drug-eluting stent—there is an increased risk of stent thrombosis as a result of the eluted drug slowing the re-endothelialisation process. Patients considered to be at high risk of developing late stent thrombosis with a drug-eluting stent may require a longer duration of treatment with clopidogrel. Prasugrel or ticagrelor are alternatives to clopidogrel in certain patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. 

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the binding of fibrinogen to receptors on platelets. Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody which binds to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors and to other related sites; it is licensed as an adjunct to heparin (unfractionated) and aspirin for the prevention of ischaemic complications in high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention. Abciximab should be used once only (to avoid additional risk of thrombocytopenia). Eptifibatide (in combination with heparin (unfractionated) and aspirin) and tirofiban (in combination with heparin (unfractionated), aspirin, and clopidogrel) also inhibit glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors; they are licensed for use to prevent early myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Tirofiban is also licensed for use in combination with heparin (unfractionated), aspirin, and clopidogrel, for the reduction of major cardiovascular events in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction intended for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Abciximab, eptifibatide and tirofiban should be used by specialists only.

Epoprostenol is also used to inhibit platelet aggregation during renal dialysis when heparins are unsuitable or contra-indicated.

Metronidazole is the drug of choice for acute invasive amoebic dysentery since it is very effective against vegetative forms of Entamoeba histolytica in ulcers. Tinidazole is also effective. Metronidazole and tinidazole are also active against amoebae which may have migrated to the liver. Treatment with metronidazole (or tinidazole) is followed by a 10-day course of diloxanide furoate.

Diloxanide furoate is the drug of choice for asymptomatic patients with E. histolytica cysts in the faeces; metronidazole and tinidazole are relatively ineffective. Diloxanide furoate is relatively free from toxic effects and the usual course is of 10 days, given alone for chronic infections or following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment.

For amoebic abscesses of the liver metronidazole is effective; tinidazole is an alternative. Aspiration of the abscess is indicated where it is suspected that it may rupture or where there is no improvement after 72 hours of metronidazole; the aspiration may need to be repeated. Aspiration aids penetration of metronidazole and, for abscesses with more than 100 mL of pus, if carried out in conjunction with drug therapy, may reduce the period of disability.

Diloxanide furoate is not effective against hepatic amoebiasis, but a 10-day course should be given at the completion of metronidazole or tinidazole treatment to destroy any amoebae in the gut.

 Trichomonacides

Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for Trichomonas vaginalis infection. Contact tracing is recommended and sexual contacts should be treated simultaneously. If metronidazole is ineffective, tinidazole may be tried.

 Antigiardial drugs

Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for Giardia lamblia infections. Alternative treatments are tinidazole or mepacrine hydrochloride.

 Leishmaniacides

Cutaneous leishmaniasis frequently heals spontaneously but if skin lesions are extensive or unsightly, treatment is indicated, as it is in visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). Leishmaniasis should be treated under specialist supervision.

Sodium stibogluconate, an organic pentavalent antimony compound, is used for visceral leishmaniasis. The dosage varies with different geographical regions and expert advice should be obtained. Some early non-inflamed lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis can be treated with intralesional injections of sodium stibogluconate under specialist supervision.

Amphotericin is used with or after an antimony compound for visceral leishmaniasis unresponsive to the antimonial alone; side-effects may be reduced by using liposomal amphotericin (AmBisome). Abelcet, a lipid formulation of amphotericin is also likely to be effective but less information is available.

Pentamidine isetionate has been used in antimony-resistant visceral leishmaniasis, but although the initial response is often good, the relapse rate is high; it is associated with serious side-effects. Other treatments include paromomycin [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies).

 Trypanocides

The prophylaxis and treatment of trypanosomiasis is difficult and differs according to the strain of organism. Expert advice should therefore be obtained.

 Drugs for toxoplasmosis

Most infections caused by Toxoplasma gondii are self-limiting, and treatment is not necessary. Exceptions are patients with eye involvement (toxoplasma choroidoretinitis), and those who are immunosuppressed. Toxoplasmic encephalitis is a common complication of AIDS. The treatment of choice is a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, given for several weeks (expert advice essential). Pyrimethamine is a folate antagonist, and adverse reactions to this combination are relatively common (folinic acid supplements and weekly blood counts needed). Alternative regimens use combinations of pyrimethamine with clindamycin or clarithromycin or azithromycin. Long-term secondary prophylaxis is required after treatment of toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients; prophylaxis should continue until immunity recovers.

If toxoplasmosis is acquired in pregnancy, transplacental infection may lead to severe disease in the fetus; specialist advice should be sought on management. Spiramycin [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) may reduce the risk of transmission of maternal infection to the fetus.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Antithyroid drugs are used for hyperthyroidism either to prepare patients for thyroidectomy or for long-term management.

Both drugs act primarily by interfering with the synthesis of thyroid hormones.</p>
    <p>Over-treatment with antithyroid drugs can result in the rapid development of hypothyroidism and should be avoided particularly during pregnancy because it can cause fetal goitre.</p>
    <p>A combination of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/carbimazole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4314\">carbimazole</xref> with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/levothyroxine-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4302\">levothyroxine sodium</xref> daily, may be used in a <i>blocking-replacement regimen</i>; therapy is usually given for 18 months. The blocking-replacement regimen is <b>not</b> suitable during pregnancy.</p>

Antithyroid drugs are used for hyperthyroidism either to prepare patients for thyroidectomy or for long-term management. In the UK carbimazole is the most commonly used drug. Propylthiouracil should be reserved for patients who are intolerant of carbimazole or for those who experience sensitivity reactions to carbimazole (sensitivity is not necessarily displayed to both drugs), and for whom other treatments are inappropriate. Both drugs act primarily by interfering with the synthesis of thyroid hormones.

Over-treatment with antithyroid drugs can result in the rapid development of hypothyroidism and should be avoided particularly during pregnancy because it can cause fetal goitre.

A combination of carbimazole with levothyroxine sodium daily, may be used in a blocking-replacement regimen; therapy is usually given for 18 months. The blocking-replacement regimen is not suitable during pregnancy.

Iodine has been used as an adjunct to antithyroid drugs for 10 to 14 days before partial thyroidectomy; however, there is little evidence of a beneficial effect. Iodine should not be used for long-term treatment because its antithyroid action tends to diminish.

Radioactive sodium iodide (131I) solution is used increasingly for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis at all ages, particularly where medical therapy or compliance is a problem, in patients with cardiac disease, and in patients who relapse after thyroidectomy.

Propranolol hydrochloride is useful for rapid relief of thyrotoxic symptoms and may be used in conjunction with antithyroid drugs or as an adjunct to radioactive iodine. Beta-blockers are also useful in neonatal thyrotoxicosis and in supraventricular arrhythmias due to hyperthyroidism. Propranolol hydrochloride has been used in conjunction with iodine to prepare mildly thyrotoxic patients for surgery but it is preferable to make the patient euthyroid with carbimazole. Laboratory tests of thyroid function are not altered by beta-blockers. Most experience in treating thyrotoxicosis has been gained with propranolol hydrochloride but nadolol is also used.

Thyrotoxic crisis (‘thyroid storm’) requires emergency treatment with intravenous administration of fluids, propranolol hydrochloride and hydrocortisone (as sodium succinate), as well as oral iodine solution and carbimazole or propylthiouracil which may need to be administered by nasogastric tube.

Pregnancy

Radioactive iodine therapy is contra-indicated during pregnancy. Propylthiouracil and carbimazole can be given but the blocking-replacement regimen is not suitable. Rarely, carbimazole has been associated with congenital defects, including aplasia cutis of the neonate, therefore propylthiouracil remains the drug of choice during the first trimester of pregnancy. In the second trimester, consider switching to carbimazole because of the potential risk of hepatotoxicity with propylthiouracil. Both propylthiouracil and carbimazole cross the placenta and in high doses may cause fetal goitre and hypothyroidism—the lowest dose that will control the hyperthyroid state should be used (requirements in Graves' disease tend to fall during pregnancy).

Cough preparations in adults

Cough suppressants

Cough may be a symptom of an underlying disorder, such as asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, or rhinitis, which should be addressed before prescribing cough suppressants. Cough may be a side-effect of another drug, such as an ACE inhibitor, or it can be associated with smoking or environmental pollutants. Cough can also have a significant habit component. When there is no identifiable cause, cough suppressants may be useful, for example if sleep is disturbed. They may cause sputum retention and this may be harmful in patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis.

Codeine phosphate may be effective but it is constipating and can cause dependence; dextromethorphan and pholcodine have fewer side-effects.

Sedating antihistamines are used as the cough suppressant component of many compound cough preparations on sale to the public; all tend to cause drowsiness which may reflect their main mode of action.

Palliative care

Diamorphine hydrochloride and methadone hydrochloride have been used to control distressing cough in terminal lung cancer although morphine is now preferred. In other circumstances they are contraindicated because they induce sputum retention and ventilatory failure as well as causing opioid dependence. Methadone hydrochloride linctus should be avoided because it has a long duration of action and tends to accumulate.

Demulcent and expectorant cough preparations

Demulcent cough preparations contain soothing substances such as syrup or glycerol and some patients believe that such preparations relieve a dry irritating cough. Preparations such as simple linctus have the advantage of being harmless and inexpensive; paediatric simple linctus is particularly useful in children.

Expectorants are claimed to promote expulsion of bronchial secretions, but there is no evidence that any drug can specifically facilitate expectoration.

Compound preparations are on sale to the public for the treatment of cough and colds but should not be used in children under 6 years; the rationale for some is dubious. Care should be taken to give the correct dose and to not use more than one preparation at a time.

Systemic nasal decongestants

Nasal decongestants for administration by mouth may not be as effective as preparations for local application but they do not give rise to rebound nasal congestion on withdrawal. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is available over the counter; it has few sympathomimetic effects.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Management of an arrhythmia requires precise diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia, and electrocardiography is essential; underlying causes such as heart failure require appropriate treatment.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Ectopic beats</p>
    <p>If ectopic beats are spontaneous and the patient has a normal heart, treatment is rarely required and reassurance to the patient will often suffice. If they are particularly troublesome, beta-blockers are sometimes effective and may be safer than other suppressant drugs.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Atrial fibrillation</p>
    <p>Treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation aims to reduce symptoms and prevent complications, especially stroke. All patients with atrial fibrillation should be assessed for their risk of stroke and thromboembolism. Atrial fibrillation can be managed by either controlling the ventricular rate (‘rate control’) or by attempting to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (‘rhythm control’). At any stage if treatment fails to control symptoms, or, if symptoms reoccur after cardioversion and specialised management is required, referral should be made within 4 weeks. If drug treatment fails to control the symptoms of atrial fibrillation or is unsuitable, ablation strategies can be considered. Review anticoagulation, stroke, and bleeding risk at least annually in all patients with atrial fibrillation.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Acute presentation </p>
      <p>All patients with life-threatening haemodynamic instability caused by new-onset atrial fibrillation should undergo emergency electrical cardioversion without delaying to achieve anticoagulation. In patients presenting acutely but without life-threatening haemodynamic instability, rate or rhythm control can be offered if the onset of arrhythmia is less than 48 hours; rate control is preferred if onset is more than 48 hours or uncertain. Consideration of pharmacological or electrical cardioversion should be based on clinical circumstances. If pharmacological cardioversion has been agreed, intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref>, or alternatively <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flecainide-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP917\">flecainide acetate</xref>, can be used (<xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref> is preferred if there is structural heart disease). If urgent rate control is required, a beta-blocker or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/verapamil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1372\">verapamil hydrochloride</xref> can be given intravenously.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Cardioversion </p>
      <p>Sinus rhythm can be restored by electrical cardioversion, or pharmacological cardioversion with an oral or intravenous antiarrhythmic drug e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flecainide-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP917\">flecainide acetate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref>. If atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 48 hours, electrical cardioversion is preferred and should not be attempted until the patient has been fully anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks; if this is not possible, parenteral anticoagulation should be commenced, and a left atrial thrombus ruled out immediately before cardioversion; oral anticoagulation should be given after cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks; prior to cardioversion, offer rate control as appropriate.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Drug treatment</p>
      <p>
        <i>Rate control</i> is the preferred first-line drug treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation except in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation, heart failure secondary to atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter suitable for an ablation strategy, atrial fibrillation with a reversible cause, or if rhythm control is more suitable based on clinical judgement. Ventricular rate can be controlled with a standard beta-blocker (not <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sotalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1020\">sotalol hydrochloride</xref>) or a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diltiazem-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1320\">diltiazem hydrochloride</xref> [unlicensed indication], or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/verapamil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1372\">verapamil hydrochloride</xref> as monotherapy. Choice of drug should be based on individual symptoms, heart rate, comorbidities, and patient preference. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/digoxin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP752\">Digoxin</xref> is usually only effective for controlling the ventricular rate at rest, and should therefore only be used as monotherapy in predominantly sedentary patients with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. When a single drug fails to adequately control the ventricular rate, a combination of two drugs including a beta-blocker, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/digoxin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP752\">digoxin</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diltiazem-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1320\">diltiazem hydrochloride</xref> can be used. If symptoms are not controlled with a combination of two drugs, a rhythm-control strategy should be considered. If ventricular function is diminished, the combination of a beta-blocker (that is licensed for use in heart failure) and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/digoxin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP752\">digoxin</xref> is preferred. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/digoxin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP752\">Digoxin</xref> is also used when atrial fibrillation is accompanied by congestive heart failure.</p>
      <p>If drug treatment is required to maintain sinus rhythm (‘rhythm control’) post-cardioversion, a standard beta-blocker is used. If a standard beta-blocker is not appropriate or is ineffective, consider an oral anti-arrhythmic drug such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sotalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1020\">sotalol hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flecainide-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP917\">flecainide acetate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propafenone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP923\">propafenone hydrochloride</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref>; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dronedarone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP904\">dronedarone</xref> may be considered in paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (see NICE guidance). If necessary, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref> can be started 4 weeks before and continuing for up to 12 months after electrical cardioversion to increase success of the procedure, and to maintain sinus rhythm. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flecainide-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP917\">Flecainide acetate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propafenone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP923\">propafenone hydrochloride</xref>should not be given when there is known ischaemic or structural heart disease. Consider <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref> in patients with left ventricular impairment or heart failure.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</p>
      <p>In symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, ventricular rhythm is controlled with a standard beta-blocker. Alternatively, if symptoms persist or a standard beta-blocker is not appropriate, an oral anti-arrhythmic drug such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dronedarone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP904\">dronedarone</xref> (see NICE guidance), <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sotalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1020\">sotalol hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flecainide-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP917\">flecainide acetate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propafenone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP923\">propafenone hydrochloride</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref> can be given (see also Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and Supraventricular arrhythmias). In selected patients with infrequent episodes of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm can be restored using the ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ approach; this involves the patient taking oral <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flecainide-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP917\">flecainide acetate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propafenone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP923\">propafenone hydrochloride</xref> to self-treat an episode of atrial fibrillation when it occurs.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Stroke prevention</p>
      <p>All patients with atrial fibrillation should be assessed for their risk of stroke and the need for thromboprophylaxis; this needs to be balanced with the patient’s risk of bleeding; a NICE guideline (NICE clinical guideline 180 (June 2014). Atrial fibrillation: The management of atrial fibrillation) recommends using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc assessment tool for stroke risk and the HAS-BLED tool for bleeding risk prior to and during anticoagulation. Risk factors for stroke taken into account by CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc include prior ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, or thromboembolic events, heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, females, and patients over 65 years. Patients with a very low risk of stroke (CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 0 for men or 1 for women) do not require an antithrombotic for stroke prevention. Parenteral anticoagulation should be offered to patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation who are receiving subtherapeutic or no anticoagulation therapy until assessment is made, and appropriate anticoagulation is started. Oral anticoagulation should be offered to patients with confirmed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in whom sinus rhythm has not been successfully restored within 48 hours of onset, patients who have had, or are at high risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation such as those with structural heart disease, prolonged history of atrial fibrillation (more than 12 months), a history of failed attempts at cardioversion, and patients whom the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of bleeding. Anticoagulation treatment should not be withheld solely because of the risk of falls, and choice of treatment should be based on clinical features and patient preferences. Oral anticoagulation may be with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/warfarin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1494\">warfarin sodium</xref>, or in non-valvular atrial fibrillation with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/apixaban.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1508\">apixaban</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dabigatran-etexilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1505\">dabigatran etexilate</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rivaroxaban.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1513\">rivaroxaban</xref>. Anticoagulants are also indicated during cardioversion procedures. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">Aspirin</xref> is less effective than <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/warfarin-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1494\">warfarin sodium</xref> at preventing emboli; the modest benefit is offset by the risk of bleeding, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> should not be offered as monotherapy solely for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. If anticoagulant treatment is contraindicated or not tolerated, left atrial appendage occlusion can be considered.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Atrial flutter</p>
    <p>Like atrial fibrillation, treatment options for atrial flutter involve either controlling the ventricular rate or attempting to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. However, atrial flutter generally responds less well to drug treatment than atrial fibrillation.</p>
    <p>Control of the ventricular rate is usually an interim measure pending restoration of sinus rhythm. Ventricular rate can be controlled by administration of a beta-blocker, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diltiazem-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1320\">diltiazem hydrochloride</xref> [unlicensed indication], or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/verapamil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1372\">verapamil hydrochloride</xref>; an intravenous beta-blocker or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/verapamil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1372\">verapamil hydrochloride</xref> is preferred for rapid control. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/digoxin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP752\">Digoxin</xref> can be added if rate control remains inadequate, and may be particularly useful in those with heart failure.</p>
    <p>Conversion to sinus rhythm can be achieved by electrical cardioversion (by cardiac pacing or direct current), pharmacological cardioversion, or catheter ablation. If the duration of atrial flutter is unknown, or it has lasted for over 48 hours, cardioversion should not be attempted until the patient has been fully anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks; if this is not possible, parenteral anticoagulation should be commenced and a left atrial thrombus ruled out immediately before cardioversion; oral anticoagulation should be given after cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks.</p>
    <p>Direct current cardioversion is usually the treatment of choice when rapid conversion to sinus rhythm is necessary (e.g. when atrial flutter is associated with haemodynamic compromise); catheter ablation is preferred for the treatment of recurrent atrial flutter. There is a limited role for anti-arrhythmic drugs as their use is not always successful. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flecainide-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP917\">Flecainide acetate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propafenone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP923\">propafenone hydrochloride</xref> can slow atrial flutter, resulting in 1:1 conduction to the ventricles, and should therefore be prescribed in conjunction with a ventricular rate controlling drug such as a beta-blocker, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diltiazem-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1320\">diltiazem hydrochloride</xref> [unlicensed indication], or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/verapamil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1372\">verapamil hydrochloride</xref>. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">Amiodarone hydrochloride</xref> can be used when other drug treatments are contra-indicated or ineffective.</p>
    <p>All patients should be assessed for their risk of stroke and the need for thromboprophylaxis; the choice of anticoagulant is based on the same criteria as for atrial fibrillation.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>

      <p>
        <i>Torsade de pointes</i> is a form of ventricular tachycardia associated with a long QT syndrome (usually drug-induced, but other factors including hypokalaemia, severe bradycardia, and genetic predisposition are also implicated). Episodes are usually self-limiting, but are frequently recurrent and can cause impairment or loss of consciousness. If not controlled, the arrhythmia can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sometimes death.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Drugs for arrhythmias</p>
    <p>Anti-arrhythmic drugs can be classified clinically into those that act on supraventricular arrhythmias (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/verapamil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1372\">verapamil hydrochloride</xref>), those that act on both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/amiodarone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP908\">amiodarone hydrochloride</xref>), and those that act on ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/lidocaine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP928\">lidocaine hydrochloride</xref>).</p>
    <p>Anti-arrhythmic drugs can also be classified according to their effects on the electrical behaviour of myocardial cells during activity (the Vaughan Williams classification) although this classification is of less clinical significance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class I: membrane stabilising drugs (e.g. lidocaine, flecainide)</li>
      <li>Class II: beta-blockers</li>
      <li>Class III: amiodarone; sotalol (also Class II)</li>
      <li>Class IV: calcium-channel blockers (includes verapamil but not dihydropyridines)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The negative inotropic effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs tend to be additive. Therefore special care should be taken if two or more are used, especially if myocardial function is impaired. Most drugs that are effective in countering arrhythmias can also provoke them in some circumstances; moreover, hypokalaemia enhances the arrhythmogenic (pro-arrhythmic) effect of many drugs.</p>

Management of an arrhythmia requires precise diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia, and electrocardiography is essential; underlying causes such as heart failure require appropriate treatment.

Ectopic beats

If ectopic beats are spontaneous and the patient has a normal heart, treatment is rarely required and reassurance to the patient will often suffice. If they are particularly troublesome, beta-blockers are sometimes effective and may be safer than other suppressant drugs.

Atrial fibrillation

Treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation aims to reduce symptoms and prevent complications, especially stroke. All patients with atrial fibrillation should be assessed for their risk of stroke and thromboembolism. Atrial fibrillation can be managed by either controlling the ventricular rate (‘rate control’) or by attempting to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (‘rhythm control’). At any stage if treatment fails to control symptoms, or, if symptoms reoccur after cardioversion and specialised management is required, referral should be made within 4 weeks. If drug treatment fails to control the symptoms of atrial fibrillation or is unsuitable, ablation strategies can be considered. Review anticoagulation, stroke, and bleeding risk at least annually in all patients with atrial fibrillation.

Acute presentation 

All patients with life-threatening haemodynamic instability caused by new-onset atrial fibrillation should undergo emergency electrical cardioversion without delaying to achieve anticoagulation. In patients presenting acutely but without life-threatening haemodynamic instability, rate or rhythm control can be offered if the onset of arrhythmia is less than 48 hours; rate control is preferred if onset is more than 48 hours or uncertain. Consideration of pharmacological or electrical cardioversion should be based on clinical circumstances. If pharmacological cardioversion has been agreed, intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, or alternatively flecainide acetate, can be used (amiodarone hydrochloride is preferred if there is structural heart disease). If urgent rate control is required, a beta-blocker or verapamil hydrochloride can be given intravenously.

Cardioversion 

Sinus rhythm can be restored by electrical cardioversion, or pharmacological cardioversion with an oral or intravenous antiarrhythmic drug e.g. flecainide acetate or amiodarone hydrochloride. If atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 48 hours, electrical cardioversion is preferred and should not be attempted until the patient has been fully anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks; if this is not possible, parenteral anticoagulation should be commenced, and a left atrial thrombus ruled out immediately before cardioversion; oral anticoagulation should be given after cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks; prior to cardioversion, offer rate control as appropriate.

Drug treatment

Rate control is the preferred first-line drug treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation except in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation, heart failure secondary to atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter suitable for an ablation strategy, atrial fibrillation with a reversible cause, or if rhythm control is more suitable based on clinical judgement. Ventricular rate can be controlled with a standard beta-blocker (not sotalol hydrochloride) or a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem hydrochloride [unlicensed indication], or verapamil hydrochloride as monotherapy. Choice of drug should be based on individual symptoms, heart rate, comorbidities, and patient preference. Digoxin is usually only effective for controlling the ventricular rate at rest, and should therefore only be used as monotherapy in predominantly sedentary patients with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. When a single drug fails to adequately control the ventricular rate, a combination of two drugs including a beta-blocker, digoxin, or diltiazem hydrochloride can be used. If symptoms are not controlled with a combination of two drugs, a rhythm-control strategy should be considered. If ventricular function is diminished, the combination of a beta-blocker (that is licensed for use in heart failure) and digoxin is preferred. Digoxin is also used when atrial fibrillation is accompanied by congestive heart failure.

If drug treatment is required to maintain sinus rhythm (‘rhythm control’) post-cardioversion, a standard beta-blocker is used. If a standard beta-blocker is not appropriate or is ineffective, consider an oral anti-arrhythmic drug such as sotalol hydrochloride, flecainide acetate, propafenone hydrochloride, or amiodarone hydrochloride; dronedarone may be considered in paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (see NICE guidance). If necessary, amiodarone hydrochloride can be started 4 weeks before and continuing for up to 12 months after electrical cardioversion to increase success of the procedure, and to maintain sinus rhythm. Flecainide acetate or propafenone hydrochlorideshould not be given when there is known ischaemic or structural heart disease. Consider amiodarone hydrochloride in patients with left ventricular impairment or heart failure.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

In symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, ventricular rhythm is controlled with a standard beta-blocker. Alternatively, if symptoms persist or a standard beta-blocker is not appropriate, an oral anti-arrhythmic drug such as dronedarone (see NICE guidance), sotalol hydrochloride, flecainide acetate, propafenone hydrochloride, or amiodarone hydrochloride can be given (see also Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and Supraventricular arrhythmias). In selected patients with infrequent episodes of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm can be restored using the ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ approach; this involves the patient taking oral flecainide acetate or propafenone hydrochloride to self-treat an episode of atrial fibrillation when it occurs.

Stroke prevention

All patients with atrial fibrillation should be assessed for their risk of stroke and the need for thromboprophylaxis; this needs to be balanced with the patient’s risk of bleeding; a NICE guideline (NICE clinical guideline 180 (June 2014). Atrial fibrillation: The management of atrial fibrillation) recommends using the CHA2DS2-VASc assessment tool for stroke risk and the HAS-BLED tool for bleeding risk prior to and during anticoagulation. Risk factors for stroke taken into account by CHA2DS2-VASc include prior ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, or thromboembolic events, heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, females, and patients over 65 years. Patients with a very low risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 for men or 1 for women) do not require an antithrombotic for stroke prevention. Parenteral anticoagulation should be offered to patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation who are receiving subtherapeutic or no anticoagulation therapy until assessment is made, and appropriate anticoagulation is started. Oral anticoagulation should be offered to patients with confirmed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in whom sinus rhythm has not been successfully restored within 48 hours of onset, patients who have had, or are at high risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation such as those with structural heart disease, prolonged history of atrial fibrillation (more than 12 months), a history of failed attempts at cardioversion, and patients whom the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of bleeding. Anticoagulation treatment should not be withheld solely because of the risk of falls, and choice of treatment should be based on clinical features and patient preferences. Oral anticoagulation may be with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g warfarin sodium, or in non-valvular atrial fibrillation with apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, or rivaroxaban. Anticoagulants are also indicated during cardioversion procedures. Aspirin is less effective than warfarin sodium at preventing emboli; the modest benefit is offset by the risk of bleeding, and aspirin should not be offered as monotherapy solely for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. If anticoagulant treatment is contraindicated or not tolerated, left atrial appendage occlusion can be considered.

Atrial flutter

Like atrial fibrillation, treatment options for atrial flutter involve either controlling the ventricular rate or attempting to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. However, atrial flutter generally responds less well to drug treatment than atrial fibrillation.

Control of the ventricular rate is usually an interim measure pending restoration of sinus rhythm. Ventricular rate can be controlled by administration of a beta-blocker, diltiazem hydrochloride [unlicensed indication], or verapamil hydrochloride; an intravenous beta-blocker or verapamil hydrochloride is preferred for rapid control. Digoxin can be added if rate control remains inadequate, and may be particularly useful in those with heart failure.

Conversion to sinus rhythm can be achieved by electrical cardioversion (by cardiac pacing or direct current), pharmacological cardioversion, or catheter ablation. If the duration of atrial flutter is unknown, or it has lasted for over 48 hours, cardioversion should not be attempted until the patient has been fully anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks; if this is not possible, parenteral anticoagulation should be commenced and a left atrial thrombus ruled out immediately before cardioversion; oral anticoagulation should be given after cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks.

Direct current cardioversion is usually the treatment of choice when rapid conversion to sinus rhythm is necessary (e.g. when atrial flutter is associated with haemodynamic compromise); catheter ablation is preferred for the treatment of recurrent atrial flutter. There is a limited role for anti-arrhythmic drugs as their use is not always successful. Flecainide acetate or propafenone hydrochloride can slow atrial flutter, resulting in 1:1 conduction to the ventricles, and should therefore be prescribed in conjunction with a ventricular rate controlling drug such as a beta-blocker, diltiazem hydrochloride [unlicensed indication], or verapamil hydrochloride. Amiodarone hydrochloride can be used when other drug treatments are contra-indicated or ineffective.

All patients should be assessed for their risk of stroke and the need for thromboprophylaxis; the choice of anticoagulant is based on the same criteria as for atrial fibrillation.

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia

This will often terminate spontaneously or with reflex vagal stimulation such as a Valsalva manoeuvre, immersing the face in ice-cold water, or carotid sinus massage; such manoeuvres should be performed with ECG monitoring.

If the effects of reflex vagal stimulation are transient or ineffective, or if the arrhythmia is causing severe symptoms, intravenous adenosine should be given. If adenosine is ineffective or contra-indicated, intravenous verapamil hydrochloride is an alternative, but it should be avoided in patients recently treated with beta-blockers.

Failure to terminate paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with reflex vagal stimulation or drug treatment may suggest an arrhythmia of atrial origin, such as focal atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter.

Treatment with direct current cardioversion is needed in haemodynamically unstable patients or when the above measures have failed to restore sinus rhythm (and an alternative diagnosis has not been found).

Recurrent episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia can be treated by catheter ablation, or prevented with drugs such as diltiazem hydrochloride, verapamil hydrochloride, beta-blockers including sotalol hydrochloride, flecainide acetate or propafenone hydrochloride.

Arrhythmias after myocardial infarction

In patients with a paroxysmal tachycardia or rapid irregularity of the pulse it is best not to administer an anti-arrhythmic until an ECG record has been obtained. Bradycardia, particularly if complicated by hypotension, should be treated with an intravenous dose of atropine sulfate the dose may be repeated if necessary. If there is a risk of asystole, or if the patient is unstable and has failed to respond to atropine sulfate, adrenaline/epinephrine should be given by intravenous infusion, and the dose adjusted according to response.

For further advice, refer to the most recent recommendations of the Resuscitation Council (UK) available at www.resus.org.uk.

Ventricular tachycardia

Pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation should be treated with immediate defibrillation (see Cardiopulmonary resuscitation).

Patients with unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia, who continue to deteriorate with signs of hypotension or reduced cardiac output, should receive direct current cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. If this fails, intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride should be administered and direct current cardioversion repeated.

Patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia who are haemodynamically stable can be treated with intravenous anti-arrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone hydrochloride is the preferred drug. Flecainide acetate, propafenone hydrochloride, and, although less effective, lidocaine hydrochloride have all been used. If sinus rhythm is not restored, direct current cardioversion or pacing should be considered. Catheter ablation is an alternative if cessation of the arrhythmia is not urgent. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia can be treated with a beta-blocker.

All patients presenting with ventricular tachycardia should be referred to a specialist. Following restoration of sinus rhythm, patients who remain at high risk of cardiac arrest will require maintenance therapy. Most patients will be treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Beta-blockers or sotalol hydrochloride (in place of a standard beta-blocker), or amiodarone hydrochloride (in combination with a standard beta-blocker), can be used in addition to the device in some patients; alternatively, they can be used alone when use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is not appropriate.

Torsade de pointes

Torsade de pointes is a form of ventricular tachycardia associated with a long QT syndrome (usually drug-induced, but other factors including hypokalaemia, severe bradycardia, and genetic predisposition are also implicated). Episodes are usually self-limiting, but are frequently recurrent and can cause impairment or loss of consciousness. If not controlled, the arrhythmia can progress to ventricular fibrillation and sometimes death. Intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate is usually effective. A beta-blocker (but not sotalol hydrochloride) and atrial (or ventricular) pacing can be considered. Anti-arrhythmics can further prolong the QT interval, thus worsening the condition.

Drugs for arrhythmias

Anti-arrhythmic drugs can be classified clinically into those that act on supraventricular arrhythmias (e.g. verapamil hydrochloride), those that act on both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. amiodarone hydrochloride), and those that act on ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. lidocaine hydrochloride).

Anti-arrhythmic drugs can also be classified according to their effects on the electrical behaviour of myocardial cells during activity (the Vaughan Williams classification) although this classification is of less clinical significance:

Class I: membrane stabilising drugs (e.g. lidocaine, flecainide)Class II: beta-blockersClass III: amiodarone; sotalol (also Class II)Class IV: calcium-channel blockers (includes verapamil but not dihydropyridines)The negative inotropic effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs tend to be additive. Therefore special care should be taken if two or more are used, especially if myocardial function is impaired. Most drugs that are effective in countering arrhythmias can also provoke them in some circumstances; moreover, hypokalaemia enhances the arrhythmogenic (pro-arrhythmic) effect of many drugs.

Supraventricular arrhythmias

Adenosine is usually the treatment of choice for terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. As it has a very short duration of action (half-life only about 8 to 10 seconds, but prolonged in those taking dipyridamole), most side-effects are short lived. Unlike verapamil hydrochloride, adenosine can be used after a beta-blocker. Verapamil hydrochloride may be preferable to adenosine in asthma.

Oral administration of a cardiac glycoside (such as digoxin) slows the ventricular response in cases of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. However, intravenous infusion of digoxin is rarely effective for rapid control of ventricular rate. Cardiac glycosides are contra-indicated in supraventricular arrhythmias associated with accessory conducting pathways (e.g. Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome).

Verapamil hydrochloride is usually effective for supraventricular tachycardias. An initial intravenous dose (important: serious beta-blocker interaction hazard) may be followed by oral treatment; hypotension may occur with large doses. It should not be used for tachyarrhythmias where the QRS complex is wide (i.e. broad complex) unless a supraventricular origin has been established beyond reasonable doubt. It is also contra-indicated in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with accessory conducting pathways (e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). It should not be used in children with arrhythmias without specialist advice; some supraventricular arrhythmias in childhood can be accelerated by verapamil hydrochloride with dangerous consequences.

Intravenous administration of a beta-blocker such as esmolol hydrochloride or propranolol hydrochloride, can achieve rapid control of the ventricular rate.

Drugs for both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias include amiodarone hydrochloride, beta-blockers, disopyramide, flecainide acetate, procainamide (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies), and propafenone hydrochloride.

Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias

Amiodarone hydrochloride is used in the treatment of arrhythmias, particularly when other drugs are ineffective or contraindicated. It can be used for paroxysmal supraventricular, nodal and ventricular tachycardias, atrial fibrillation and flutter, and ventricular fibrillation. It can also be used for tachyarrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome. It should be initiated only under hospital or specialist supervision. Amiodarone hydrochloride may be given by intravenous infusion as well as by mouth, and has the advantage of causing little or no myocardial depression. Unlike oral amiodarone hydrochloride, intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride acts relatively rapidly.

Intravenous injection of amiodarone hydrochloride can be used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless tachycardia unresponsive to other interventions.

Amiodarone hydrochloride has a very long half-life (extending to several weeks) and only needs to be given once daily (but high doses can cause nausea unless divided). Many weeks or months may be required to achieve steady-state plasma-amiodarone concentration; this is particularly important when drug interactions are likely.

Beta-blockers act as anti-arrhythmic drugs principally by attenuating the effects of the sympathetic system on automaticity and conductivity within the heart. Sotalol hydrochloride has a role in the management of ventricular arrhythmias.

Disopyramide can be given by intravenous injection to control arrhythmias after myocardial infarction (including those not responding to lidocaine hydrochloride), but it impairs cardiac contractility. Oral administration of disopyramide is useful, but it has an antimuscarinic effect which limits its use in patients susceptible to angle-closure glaucoma or with prostatic hyperplasia.

Flecainide acetate belongs to the same general class as lidocaine hydrochloride and may be of value for serious symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. It may also be indicated for junctional re-entry tachycardias and for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, it can precipitate serious arrhythmias in a small minority of patients (including those with otherwise normal hearts).

Propafenone hydrochloride is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias and also for some supraventricular arrhythmias. It has complex mechanisms of action, including weak beta-blocking activity (therefore caution is needed in obstructive airways disease—contra- indicated if severe).

Drugs for supraventricular arrhythmias include adenosine, cardiac glycosides, and verapamil hydrochloride. Drugs for ventricular arrhythmias include lidocaine hydrochloride.

Mexiletine and procainamide are both available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies. Mexiletine can be used for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias; procainamide is given by intravenous injection to control ventricular arrhythmias.

Ventricular arrhythmias

Intravenous lidocaine hydrochloride can be used for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in haemodynamically stable patients, and ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia in cardiac arrest refractory to defibrillation, however it is no longer the anti-arrhythmic drug of first choice.

Drugs for both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias include amiodarone hydrochloride, beta-blockers, disopyramide, flecainide acetate, procainamide (available from ‘special- order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies), and propafenone hydrochloride.

Mexiletine is available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies for treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is indicated for pain and stiffness resulting from inflammatory rheumatic disease; analgesics such as paracetamol or codeine phosphate can also be used.

Drugs are also used to influence the rheumatic disease process itself . For rheumatoid arthritis these disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) include methotrexate, cytokine modulators, azathioprine, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, penicillamine, gold, antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate), and sulfasalazine. Corticosteroids also have a significant role in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.

Drugs which may affect the disease process in psoriatic arthritis include sulfasalazine, gold, azathioprine, methotrexate, leflunomide, and cytokine modulators.

Osteoarthritis and soft-tissue disorders

For pain relief in osteoarthritis and soft-tissue disorders, paracetamol should be used first and may need to be taken regularly. A topical NSAID or topical capsaicin 0.025% should also be considered, particularly in knee or hand osteoarthritis. An oral NSAID can be substituted for, or used in addition to, paracetamol. If further pain relief is required in osteoarthritis, then the addition of an opioid analgesic may be considered, but with a substantial risk of adverse effects; however, an opioid analgesic should be considered before a NSAID in patients taking low-dose aspirin. 

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may produce temporary benefit in osteoarthritis, especially if associated with soft-tissue inflammation.

Non-drug measures, such as weight reduction and exercise, should also be encouraged.

Glucosamine and rubefacients are not recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis.

Hyaluronic acid and its derivatives are available for osteoarthritis of the knee, but are not recommended. Sodium hyaluronate (Durolane, Euflexxa, Fermathron, Hyalgan, Orthovisc, Ostenil, Ostenil Plus, RenehaVis, Suplasyn, Synocrom, Synopsis) or hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc ) is injected intra-articularly to supplement natural hyaluronic acid in the synovial fluid.

Drugs used in the management of asthma include beta2 agonists, antimuscarinic bronchodilators, theophylline, corticosteroids, sodium cromoglicate and nedocromil sodium, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and, in specialist centres, omalizumab.

Management of chronic asthma

Important: Start at step most appropriate to initial severity; before initiating a new drug consider whether diagnosis is correct, check compliance and inhaler technique, and eliminate trigger factors for acute exacerbations.

Advice on the management of chronic asthma is based on the recommendations of the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (updated January 2012); updates available at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk.

Adult and child over 5 years

Step 1: occasional relief bronchodilator

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist as required (up to once daily).Move to step 2 if needed more than twice a week, or if night-time symptoms at least once a week, or if exacerbation in the last 2 yearsStep 2: regular inhaled preventer therapy

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist as required plusRegular standard-dose inhaled corticosteroid (alternatives to inhaled corticosteroid are leukotriene receptor antagonists, theophylline, inhaled sodium cromoglicate, or inhaled nedocromil sodium, but are considerably less effective)Step 3: inhaled corticosteroid + long-acting inhaled beta2 agonist

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist as required plusRegular standard-dose inhaled corticosteroid plusRegular inhaled long-acting beta2 agonist (salmeterolorformoterol fumarate); if asthma not controlled increase dose of inhaled corticosteroid to upper end of standard dose range andEither stop long-acting beta2 agonist if of no benefit or continue long-acting beta2 agonist if of some benefit; if asthma still not controlled and long-acting beta2 agonist stopped, add one of:Leukotriene receptor antagonistModified-release oral theophyllineModified-release oral beta2 agonist (child under 12 years not recommended).Step 4: high-dose inhaled corticosteroid + regular bronchodilators

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist as required withRegular high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plusInhaled long-acting beta2 agonist plusIn adults 6-week sequential therapeutic trial of one or more of:Leukotriene receptor antagonistModified-release oral theophyllineModified-release oral beta2 agonistStep 5: regular corticosteroid tablets (refer to a respiratory specialist)

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist as required withRegular high-dose inhaled corticosteroid andOne or more long-acting bronchodilators (see step 4) plusRegular prednisolone tablets (as single daily dose); in addition to regular prednisolone, continue high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (in exceptional cases may exceed licensed doses); these patients should normally be referred to an asthma clinicStepping down

Review treatment every 3 months; if control achieved, stepwise reduction may be possible; reduce dose of inhaled corticosteroid slowly (consider reduction every 3 months, decreasing dose by up to 50% each time)Child under 5 years

Lung function measurements cannot be used to guide management of those under 5 years.

Step 1: occasional relief bronchodilator

Short-acting beta2 agonist as required (not more than once daily); preferably by inhalation (less effective and more side-effects when given by mouth)Move to step 2 if needed more than twice a week, or if night-time symptoms at least once a week, or if exacerbation in the last 2 yearsStep 2: regular preventer therapy

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist as required plusEither regular standard-dose inhaled corticosteroidOr (if inhaled corticosteroid cannot be used) leukotriene receptor antagonistStep 3: add-on therapy

Child under 2 years: Refer to respiratory paediatricianChild 2–5 years: Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist as required plusRegular inhaled corticosteroid in standard dose plusLeukotriene receptor antagonistStep 4: persistent poor control

Refer to respiratory paediatrician.Stepping down

Regularly review need for treatment.Standard-dose inhaled corticosteroids

Beclometasone dipropionate or budesonide:

Adult and child over 12 years 100–400 micrograms twice dailyChild under 12 years 100–200 micrograms twice dailyFluticasone propionate:

Adult and child over 12 years 50–200 micrograms twice dailyChild 4–12 years 50–100 micrograms twice dailyMometasone furoate:

Adult and child over 12 years 400 micrograms as a single dose in the evening or in 2 divided dosesChild under 12 years not recommendedDose adjustments may be required for some inhaler devices, see individual preparations.

High-dose inhaled corticosteroids

Adult and child over 12 years 400 micrograms twice dailyChild under 12 years not recommendedDose adjustments may be required for some inhaler devices, see individual preparations.

Failure to achieve control with these doses is unusual.

Management of acute asthma

Important: Patients with severe or life-threatening acute asthma may not be distressed and may not have all these abnormalities; the presence of any should alert the doctor Regard each emergency consultation as being for severe acute asthma until shown otherwise.

Moderate acute asthma

Able to talkRespiration (breaths/minute) < 25; child 2–5 years ≤ 40, 5–12 years ≤ 30Pulse (beats/minute) < 110; child 2–5 years ≤ 140, 5–12 years ≤ 125Arterial oxygen saturation ≥ 92%Peak flow > 50% of predicted or best; child 5–12 years ≥ 50%Treat at home or in surgery and assess response to treatment

Treatment

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist via a large-volume spacer or oxygen-driven nebuliser (if available); give salbutamol 100 micrograms/metered inhalation each inhaled separately, and repeat at 10–20 minute intervals if necessary or give nebulised salbutamol or terbutaline sulfate, and repeat at 20–30 minute intervals if necessaryPrednisolone by mouth for at least 5 days; and for up to 3 days in children, or longer if necessary. If the child has been taking an oral corticosteroid for more than a few days, give prednisolone at the upper end of the dose range.Monitor response for 15–30 minutes

If response is poor or a relapse occurs in 3–4 hours, send immediately to hospital for assessment and further treatment.

Severe acute asthma

Cannot complete sentences in one breath; in children, too breathless to talk or feedRespiration (breaths/minute) ≥ 25; child 2–5 years > 40; 5–12 years > 30Pulse (beats/minute) ≥ 110; child 2–5 years > 140; 5–12 years > 125Arterial oxygen saturation ≥ 92%; child under 12 years < 92%Peak flow 33–50% of predicted or best; child 5–12 years 33–50%Start treatment below and send immediately to hospital.

Treatment

High-flow oxygen (if available)Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist via a large-volume spacer or oxygen-driven nebuliser (if available) as for moderate acute asthmaPrednisolone by mouth as for moderate acute asthma or intravenous hydrocortisone (preferably as sodium succinate) every 6 hours until conversion to oral prednisolone is possibleMonitor response for 15–30 minutes

If response is poor:

Inhaled ipratropium bromide via oxygen-driven nebuliser (if available) every 4–6 hours in adults; or every 20–30 minutes for the first 2 hours, then every 4–6 hours as necessary in children.Refer those who fail to respond and require ventilatory support to an intensive care or high-dependency unit

Consider intravenous beta2 agonist, aminophylline, or magnesium sulfate [unlicensed indication] only after consultation with senior medical staff.Life-threatening acute asthma

Silent chest, feeble respiratory effort, cyanosisHypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia, exhaustion, agitation (in children), or reduced level of consciousnessArterial oxygen saturation < 92%Peak flow < 33% of predicted or best; child 5–12 years < 33%Start treatment below and send immediately to hospital; consult with senior medical staff and refer to intensive care

Treatment

High-flow oxygen (if available)Short-acting beta2 agonist via oxygen-driven nebuliser (if available); give salbutamol or terbutaline, and repeat at 20–30 minute intervals or as necessary; reserve intravenous beta2 agonists for those in whom inhaled therapy cannot be used reliablyPrednisolone by mouth as for moderate acute asthma or intravenous hydrocortisone as for severe acute asthmaInhaled ipratropium bromide via oxygen-driven nebuliser (if available) as for severe acute asthmaMonitor response for 15–30 minutes

If response is poor:

Consider intravenous aminophylline or magnesium sulfate [unlicensed indication] only after consultation with senior medical staff.Management of severe acute asthma

Important

Regard each emergency consultation as being for severe acute asthma until shown otherwise. Failure to respond adequately at any time requires immediate transfer to hospital.

Severe acute asthma can be fatal and must be treated promptly. All patients with severe acute asthma should be given high-flow oxygen (if available) and an inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist via a large-volume spacer or nebuliser; give salbutamol 100 micrograms/metered inhalation, each puff inhaled separately via a large volume spacer, and repeat at 10–20 minute intervals or as necessary. If there are life-threatening features, give salbutamol or terbutaline sulfate via an oxygen-driven nebuliser every 20–30 minutes or as necessary. In all cases, a systemic corticosteroid should be given. For adults, give prednisolone by mouth for at least 5 days, or intravenous hydrocortisone (preferably as sodium succinate) every 6 hours until conversion to oral prednisolone is possible. For children, give prednisolone by mouth for up to 3 days, or longer if necessary, or intravenous hydrocortisone (preferably as sodium succinate) every 6 hours until conversion to oral prednisolone is possible. If the child has been taking an oral corticosteroid for more than a few days, then give prednisolone at the upper end of the dose range. In severe or life-threatening asthma, also consider initial treatment with ipratropium bromide by nebuliser.

Most patients do not require and do not benefit from the addition of intravenousaminophylline or of intravenous beta2 agonist; both cause more adverse effects than nebulised beta2 agonists. Nevertheless, an occasional patient who has not been taking theophylline may benefit from aminophylline infusion. A single dose of magnesium sulfate [unlicensed indication] by intravenous infusion over 20 minutes can be used for patients with severe acute asthma, but evidence of benefit is limited.

Treatment of severe acute asthma is safer in hospital where resuscitation facilities are immediately available. Treatment should never be delayed for investigations, patients should never be sedated, and the possibility of a pneumothorax should be considered.

If the patient’s condition deteriorates despite pharmacological treatment, intermittent positive pressure ventilation may be needed.

Follow up in all cases

Episodes of acute asthma should be regarded as a failure of preventative therapy. A careful history should be taken to establish the reason for the exacerbation. Monitor symptoms and peak flow. Inhaler technique should be checked and regular treatment should be reviewed in accordance with the Management of Chronic Asthma. Patients should be given a written asthma action plan aimed at preventing relapse, optimising treatment, and preventing delay in seeking assistance in future exacerbations. Follow-up within 48 hours should be arranged with the general practitioner or appropriate primary care health professional. Patients should also be reviewed by a respiratory specialist within one month of the exacerbation.

    <p>Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (beta-blockers) block the beta-adrenoceptors in the heart, peripheral vasculature, bronchi, pancreas, and liver.</p>
    <p>Many beta-blockers are now available and in general they are all equally effective. There are, however, differences between them, which may affect choice in treating particular diseases or individual patients.</p>
    <p>Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA, partial agonist activity) represents the capacity of beta-blockers to stimulate as well as to block adrenergic receptors. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/oxprenolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1006\">Oxprenolol hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pindolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1013\">pindolol</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/acebutolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP952\">acebutolol</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/celiprolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP978\">celiprolol hydrochloride</xref> have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; they tend to cause less bradycardia than the other beta-blockers and may also cause less coldness of the extremities.</p>
    <p>Some beta-blockers are lipid soluble and some are water soluble. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atenolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP954\">Atenolol</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/celiprolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP978\">celiprolol hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nadolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1001\">nadolol</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sotalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1020\">sotalol hydrochloride</xref> are the most water-soluble; they are less likely to enter the brain, and may therefore cause less sleep disturbance and nightmares. Water-soluble beta-blockers are excreted by the kidneys and dosage reduction is often necessary in renal impairment.</p>
    <p>Beta-blockers with a relatively short duration of action have to be given two or three times daily. Many of these are, however, available in modified-release formulations so that administration once daily is adequate for hypertension. For angina twice-daily treatment may sometimes be needed even with a modified-release formulation. Some beta-blockers, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atenolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP954\">atenolol</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bisoprolol-fumarate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP971\">bisoprolol fumarate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/celiprolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP978\">celiprolol hydrochloride</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nadolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1001\">nadolol</xref>, have an intrinsically longer duration of action and need to be given only once daily.</p>
    <p>Beta-blockers slow the heart and can depress the myocardium; they are contra-indicated in patients with second- or third-degree heart block. Beta-blockers should also be avoided in patients with worsening unstable heart failure; care is required when initiating a beta-blocker in those with stable heart failure.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/labetalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP989\">Labetalol hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/celiprolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP978\">celiprolol hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/carvedilol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP975\">carvedilol</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nebivolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1003\">nebivolol</xref> are beta-blockers that have, in addition, an arteriolar vasodilating action, by diverse mechanisms, and thus lower peripheral resistance. There is no evidence that these drugs have important advantages over other beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension.</p>
    <p>Beta-blockers can precipitate bronchospasm and should therefore usually be avoided in patients with a history of asthma. When there is no suitable alternative, it may be necessary for a patient with well-controlled asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (without significant reversible airways obstruction), to receive treatment with a beta-blocker for a co-existing condition (e.g. heart failure or following myocardial infarction). In this situation, a cardioselective beta-blocker should be selected and initiated at a low dose by a specialist; the patient should be closely monitored for adverse effects. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atenolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP954\">Atenolol</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bisoprolol-fumarate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP971\">bisoprolol fumarate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoprolol-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP993\">metoprolol tartrate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nebivolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1003\">nebivolol</xref>, and (to a lesser extent) <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/acebutolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP952\">acebutolol</xref>, have less effect on the beta<sub>2</sub> (bronchial) receptors and are, therefore, relatively <i>cardioselective</i>, but they are not <i>cardiospecific</i>. They have a lesser effect on airways resistance but are not free of this side-effect.</p>
    <p>Beta-blockers are also associated with fatigue, coldness of the extremities (may be less common with those with ISA), and sleep disturbances with nightmares (may be less common with the water-soluble beta-blockers).</p>
    <p>Beta-blockers can affect carbohydrate metabolism, causing hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia in patients with or without diabetes; they can also interfere with metabolic and autonomic responses to hypoglycaemia, thereby masking symptoms such as tachycardia. However, beta-blockers are not contra-indicated in diabetes, although the cardioselective beta-blockers may be preferred. Beta-blockers should be avoided altogether in those with frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. Beta-blockers, especially when combined with a thiazide diuretic, should be avoided for the routine treatment of uncomplicated hypertension in patients with diabetes or in those at high risk of developing diabetes.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypertension</p>
      <p>The mode of action of beta-blockers in hypertension is not understood, but they reduce cardiac output, alter baroceptor reflex sensitivity, and block peripheral adrenoceptors. Some beta-blockers depress plasma renin secretion. It is possible that a central effect may also partly explain their mode of action.</p>
      <p>Beta-blockers are effective for reducing blood pressure but other antihypertensives are usually more effective for reducing the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality, especially in the elderly. Other antihypertensives are therefore preferred for routine initial treatment of uncomplicated hypertension.</p>
      <p>In general, the dose of a beta-blocker does not have to be high.</p>
      <p>Beta-blockers can be used to control the pulse rate in patients with <i>phaeochromocytoma</i>. However, they should never be used alone as beta-blockade without concurrent alpha-blockade may lead to a hypertensive crisis. For this reason <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/phenoxybenzamine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1117\">phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride</xref> should always be used together with the beta-blocker.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Angina</p>
      <p>By reducing cardiac work beta-blockers improve exercise tolerance and relieve symptoms in patients with <i>angina</i> (see management of stable angina and acute coronary syndromes for further details). As with hypertension there is no good evidence of the superiority of any one drug, although occasionally a patient will respond better to one beta-blocker than to another. There is some evidence that sudden withdrawal may cause an exacerbation of angina and therefore gradual reduction of dose is preferable when beta-blockers are to be stopped. There is a risk of precipitating heart failure when beta-blockers and verapamil are used together in established ischaemic heart disease.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Myocardial infarction</p>
      <p>For specific comments see management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.</p>
      <p>Several studies have shown that some beta-blockers can reduce the recurrence rate of <i>myocardial infarction</i>. However, uncontrolled heart failure, hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and obstructive airways disease render beta-blockers unsuitable in some patients following a myocardial infarction. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atenolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP954\">Atenolol</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoprolol-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP993\">metoprolol tartrate</xref> may reduce early mortality after intravenous and subsequent oral administration in the acute phase, while <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/acebutolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP952\">acebutolol</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoprolol-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP993\">metoprolol tartrate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propranolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP944\">propranolol hydrochloride</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/timolol-maleate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1025\">timolol maleate</xref> have protective value when started in the early convalescent phase. The evidence relating to other beta-blockers is less convincing; some have not been tested in trials of secondary prevention.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Arrhythmias</p>
      <p>Beta-blockers act as <i>anti-arrhythmic drugs</i> principally by attenuating the effects of the sympathetic system on automaticity and conductivity within the heart. They can be used in conjunction with digoxin to control the ventricular response in atrial fibrillation, especially in patients with thyrotoxicosis. Beta-blockers are also useful in the management of supraventricular tachycardias, and are used to control those following myocardial infarction.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/esmolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP987\">Esmolol hydrochloride</xref> is a relatively cardioselective beta-blocker with a very short duration of action, used intravenously for the short-term treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, or hypertension, particularly in the peri-operative period. It may also be used in other situations, such as acute myocardial infarction, when sustained beta-blockade might be hazardous.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sotalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1020\">Sotalol hydrochloride</xref>, a non-cardioselective beta-blocker with additional class III anti-arrhythmic activity, is used for prophylaxis in paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. It also suppresses ventricular ectopic beats and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. It has been shown to be more effective than lidocaine in the termination of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia due to coronary disease or cardiomyopathy. However, it may induce torsade de pointes in susceptible patients.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Heart failure</p>
      <p>Beta-blockers may produce benefit in heart failure by blocking sympathetic activity. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bisoprolol-fumarate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP971\">Bisoprolol fumarate</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/carvedilol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP975\">carvedilol</xref> reduce mortality in any grade of stable heart failure; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nebivolol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1003\">nebivolol</xref> is licensed for stable mild to moderate heart failure in patients over 70 years. Treatment should be initiated by those experienced in the management of heart failure.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Thyrotoxicosis</p>
      <p>Beta-blockers are used in pre-operative preparation for thyroidectomy. Administration of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propranolol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP944\">propranolol hydrochloride</xref> can reverse clinical symptoms of <i>thyrotoxicosis</i> within 4 days. Routine tests of increased thyroid function remain unaltered. The thyroid gland is rendered less vascular thus making surgery easier.</p>

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Other uses</p>
      <p>Beta-blockers have been used to alleviate some symptoms of <i>anxiety</i>; probably patients with palpitation, tremor, and tachycardia respond best.

Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (beta-blockers) block the beta-adrenoceptors in the heart, peripheral vasculature, bronchi, pancreas, and liver.

Many beta-blockers are now available and in general they are all equally effective. There are, however, differences between them, which may affect choice in treating particular diseases or individual patients.

Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA, partial agonist activity) represents the capacity of beta-blockers to stimulate as well as to block adrenergic receptors. Oxprenolol hydrochloride, pindolol, acebutolol, and celiprolol hydrochloride have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; they tend to cause less bradycardia than the other beta-blockers and may also cause less coldness of the extremities.

Some beta-blockers are lipid soluble and some are water soluble. Atenolol, celiprolol hydrochloride, nadolol, and sotalol hydrochloride are the most water-soluble; they are less likely to enter the brain, and may therefore cause less sleep disturbance and nightmares. Water-soluble beta-blockers are excreted by the kidneys and dosage reduction is often necessary in renal impairment.

Beta-blockers with a relatively short duration of action have to be given two or three times daily. Many of these are, however, available in modified-release formulations so that administration once daily is adequate for hypertension. For angina twice-daily treatment may sometimes be needed even with a modified-release formulation. Some beta-blockers, such as atenolol, bisoprolol fumarate, celiprolol hydrochloride, and nadolol, have an intrinsically longer duration of action and need to be given only once daily.

Beta-blockers slow the heart and can depress the myocardium; they are contra-indicated in patients with second- or third-degree heart block. Beta-blockers should also be avoided in patients with worsening unstable heart failure; care is required when initiating a beta-blocker in those with stable heart failure.

Labetalol hydrochloride, celiprolol hydrochloride, carvedilol, and nebivolol are beta-blockers that have, in addition, an arteriolar vasodilating action, by diverse mechanisms, and thus lower peripheral resistance. There is no evidence that these drugs have important advantages over other beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension.

Beta-blockers can precipitate bronchospasm and should therefore usually be avoided in patients with a history of asthma. When there is no suitable alternative, it may be necessary for a patient with well-controlled asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (without significant reversible airways obstruction), to receive treatment with a beta-blocker for a co-existing condition (e.g. heart failure or following myocardial infarction). In this situation, a cardioselective beta-blocker should be selected and initiated at a low dose by a specialist; the patient should be closely monitored for adverse effects. Atenolol, bisoprolol fumarate, metoprolol tartrate, nebivolol, and (to a lesser extent) acebutolol, have less effect on the beta2 (bronchial) receptors and are, therefore, relatively cardioselective, but they are not cardiospecific. They have a lesser effect on airways resistance but are not free of this side-effect.

Beta-blockers are also associated with fatigue, coldness of the extremities (may be less common with those with ISA), and sleep disturbances with nightmares (may be less common with the water-soluble beta-blockers).

Beta-blockers can affect carbohydrate metabolism, causing hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia in patients with or without diabetes; they can also interfere with metabolic and autonomic responses to hypoglycaemia, thereby masking symptoms such as tachycardia. However, beta-blockers are not contra-indicated in diabetes, although the cardioselective beta-blockers may be preferred. Beta-blockers should be avoided altogether in those with frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. Beta-blockers, especially when combined with a thiazide diuretic, should be avoided for the routine treatment of uncomplicated hypertension in patients with diabetes or in those at high risk of developing diabetes.

Hypertension

The mode of action of beta-blockers in hypertension is not understood, but they reduce cardiac output, alter baroceptor reflex sensitivity, and block peripheral adrenoceptors. Some beta-blockers depress plasma renin secretion. It is possible that a central effect may also partly explain their mode of action.

Beta-blockers are effective for reducing blood pressure but other antihypertensives are usually more effective for reducing the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality, especially in the elderly. Other antihypertensives are therefore preferred for routine initial treatment of uncomplicated hypertension.

In general, the dose of a beta-blocker does not have to be high.

Beta-blockers can be used to control the pulse rate in patients with phaeochromocytoma. However, they should never be used alone as beta-blockade without concurrent alpha-blockade may lead to a hypertensive crisis. For this reason phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride should always be used together with the beta-blocker.

Angina

By reducing cardiac work beta-blockers improve exercise tolerance and relieve symptoms in patients with angina (see management of stable angina and acute coronary syndromes for further details). As with hypertension there is no good evidence of the superiority of any one drug, although occasionally a patient will respond better to one beta-blocker than to another. There is some evidence that sudden withdrawal may cause an exacerbation of angina and therefore gradual reduction of dose is preferable when beta-blockers are to be stopped. There is a risk of precipitating heart failure when beta-blockers and verapamil are used together in established ischaemic heart disease.

Myocardial infarction

For specific comments see management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Several studies have shown that some beta-blockers can reduce the recurrence rate of myocardial infarction. However, uncontrolled heart failure, hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and obstructive airways disease render beta-blockers unsuitable in some patients following a myocardial infarction. Atenolol and metoprolol tartrate may reduce early mortality after intravenous and subsequent oral administration in the acute phase, while acebutolol, metoprolol tartrate, propranolol hydrochloride, and timolol maleate have protective value when started in the early convalescent phase. The evidence relating to other beta-blockers is less convincing; some have not been tested in trials of secondary prevention.

Arrhythmias

Beta-blockers act as anti-arrhythmic drugs principally by attenuating the effects of the sympathetic system on automaticity and conductivity within the heart. They can be used in conjunction with digoxin to control the ventricular response in atrial fibrillation, especially in patients with thyrotoxicosis. Beta-blockers are also useful in the management of supraventricular tachycardias, and are used to control those following myocardial infarction.

Esmolol hydrochloride is a relatively cardioselective beta-blocker with a very short duration of action, used intravenously for the short-term treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, or hypertension, particularly in the peri-operative period. It may also be used in other situations, such as acute myocardial infarction, when sustained beta-blockade might be hazardous.

Sotalol hydrochloride, a non-cardioselective beta-blocker with additional class III anti-arrhythmic activity, is used for prophylaxis in paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. It also suppresses ventricular ectopic beats and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. It has been shown to be more effective than lidocaine in the termination of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia due to coronary disease or cardiomyopathy. However, it may induce torsade de pointes in susceptible patients.

Heart failure

Beta-blockers may produce benefit in heart failure by blocking sympathetic activity. Bisoprolol fumarate and carvedilol reduce mortality in any grade of stable heart failure; nebivolol is licensed for stable mild to moderate heart failure in patients over 70 years. Treatment should be initiated by those experienced in the management of heart failure.

Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-blockers are used in pre-operative preparation for thyroidectomy. Administration of propranolol hydrochloride can reverse clinical symptoms of thyrotoxicosis within 4 days. Routine tests of increased thyroid function remain unaltered. The thyroid gland is rendered less vascular thus making surgery easier.

Other uses

Beta-blockers have been used to alleviate some symptoms of anxiety; probably patients with palpitation, tremor, and tachycardia respond best. Beta-blockers are also used in the prophylaxis of migraine. Betaxolol, carteolol hydrochloride, levobunolol hydrochloride, and timolol maleate are used topically in glaucoma.

The use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and of endoscopic biliary techniques has limited the place of the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid in gallstone disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid is suitable for patients with unimpaired gall bladder function, small or medium-sized radiolucent stones, and whose mild symptoms are not amenable to other treatment. Long-term prophylaxis may be needed after complete dissolution of the gallstones has been confirmed because they may recur in up to 25% of patients within one year of stopping treatment.

Ursodeoxycholic acid is also used in primary biliary cirrhosis; liver tests improve in most patients but the effect on overall survival is uncertain.

A terpene mixture (Rowachol) raises biliary cholesterol solubility. It is not considered to be a useful adjunct.

Bile acid sequestrants

Colestyramine is an anion-exchange resin that is not absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. It relieves diarrhoea and pruritus by forming an insoluble complex with bile acids in the intestine.

Pancreatin

Supplements of pancreatin are given by mouth to compensate for reduced or absent exocrine secretion in cystic fibrosis, and following pancreatectomy, gastrectomy, or chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatin may also be necessary if a tumour (e.g. pancreatic cancer) obstructs outflow from the pancreas.

Various solutions are available as irrigations or washouts.

Aqueous chlorhexidine can be used in the management of common infections of the bladder but it is ineffective against most Pseudomonas spp. Solutions containing chlorhexidine 1 in 5000 (0.02%) are used but they may irritate the mucosa and cause burning and haematuria (in which case they should be discontinued); sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9% (physiological saline) is usually adequate and is preferred as a mechanical irrigant.

Continuous bladder irrigation with amphotericin 50 micrograms/mL may be of value in mycotic infections in adults.

Dissolution of blood clots

Clot retention is usually treated by irrigation with sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9% but sterile sodium citrate solution for bladder irrigation 3% may also be helpful.

Bladder cancer

Bladder instillations of doxorubicin hydrochloride and mitomycin are used for recurrent superficial bladder tumours. Such instillations reduce systemic side-effects; adverse effects on the bladder (e.g. micturition disorders and reduction in bladder capacity) may occur.

Instillation of epirubicin hydrochloride is used for treatment and prophylaxis of certain forms of superficial bladder cancer; instillation of doxorubicin hydrochloride is also used for some papillary tumours.

Instillation of BCG (bacillus calmette-guérin), a live attenuated strain derived from Mycobacterium bovis is licensed for the treatment of primary or recurrent bladder carcinoma in-situ and for the prevention of recurrence following transurethral resection.

Urological surgery

Glycine irrigation solution 1.5% is the irrigant of choice for transurethral resection of the prostate gland and bladder tumours; sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9% (physiological saline) is used for percutaneous renal surgery.

Maintenance of indwelling urinary catheters

The deposition which occurs in catheterised patients is usually chiefly composed of phosphate and to minimise this the catheter (if latex) should be changed at least as often as every 6 weeks. If the catheter is to be left for longer periods a silicone catheter should be used together with the appropriate use of catheter maintenance solutions.

Also see: calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and oestrogens in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis

The bisphosphonates (alendronic acid and risedronate) are effective for preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is an option where other therapies are contra-indicated, cannot be tolerated, or if there is a lack of response. The CSM has advised that HRT should not be considered first-line therapy for long-term prevention of osteoporosis in women over 50 years of age. HRT is of most benefit for the prophylaxis of postmenopausal osteoporosis if started early in menopause and continued for up to 5 years, but bone loss resumes (possibly at an accelerated rate) on stopping HRT. Women of Afro-Caribbean origin appear to be less susceptible to osteoporosis than those who are white or of Asian origin.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis may be treated with a bisphosphonate. The bisphosphonates (such as alendronate and risedronate) decrease the risk of vertebral fracture; alendronate and risedronate have also been shown to reduce non-vertebral fractures. If bisphosphonates are unsuitable calcitriol or strontium ranelate may be considered. Calcitonin (salmon) is no longer recommended for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis as the benefits are outweighed by the risk of malignancy associated with long-term use. Calcitonin (salmon) [unlicensed indication] has been used for pain relief for up to 3 months after a vertebral fracture when other analgesics were ineffective, but the benefits of treatment should be balanced against the risks. Parathyroid hormone, and teriparatide have been introduced for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Raloxifene hydrochloride is licensed for the prophylaxis and treatment of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women.

Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis

To reduce the risk of osteoporosis doses of oral corticosteroids should be as low as possible and courses of treatment as short as possible. The risk of osteoporosis may be related to cumulative dose of corticosteroids; even intermittent courses can therefore increase the risk. The greatest rate of bone loss occurs during the first 6–12 months of corticosteroid use and so early steps to prevent the development of osteoporosis are important. Long-term use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids may also contribute to corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

Patients taking (or who are likely to take) an oral corticosteroid for 3 months or longer should be assessed and where necessary given prophylactic treatment; those aged over 65 years are at greater risk. Patients taking oral corticosteroids who have sustained a low trauma fracture should receive treatment for osteoporosis. The therapeutic options for prophylaxis and treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis are the same:

a bisphosphonate; Calcitriol [unlicensed indication];hormone replacement (HRT in women, testosterone in men [unlicensed indication]).Calcitonin and parathyroid hormone

Calcitonin is involved with parathyroid hormone in the regulation of bone turnover and hence in the maintenance of calcium balance and homoeostasis. Calcitonin (salmon) (synthetic or recombinant salmon calcitonin) is used to lower the plasma-calcium concentration in patients with hypercalcaemia associated with malignancy.

Calcitonin (salmon) is also licensed for treatment of Paget’s disease of bone when other treatments are ineffective or inappropriate; it is also licensed for the prevention of acute bone loss due to sudden immobility. Calcitonin (salmon) is no longer recommended for the prevention or treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis because the benefits are outweighed by the risk of malignancy associated with long-term use.

Recombinant parathyroid hormone is used for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Teriparatide (a recombinant fragment of parathyroid hormone) is used for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, osteoporosis in men at increased risk of fracture, and corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

Cinacalcet is licensed for the treatment of hypercalcaemia in parathyroid carcinoma.

Bisphosphonates

Bisphosphonates have an important role in the prophylaxis and treatment of osteoporosis and corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis; alendronic acid or risedronate sodium are considered the drugs of choice for these conditions.

Bisphosphonates are also used in the treatment of Paget’s disease, hypercalcaemia of malignancy, and in bone metastases in breast cancer.

Strontium ranelate

Strontium ranelate treatment has been associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction, and the risk should be assessed before treatment and regularly during treatment. Strontium ranelate should be initiated only by specialists for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women or men at high risk of fracture for whom other treatments are contra-indicated or not tolerated.

Selective beta2 agonists produce bronchodilation. A short-acting beta2 agonist is used for immediate relief of asthma symptoms while some long-acting beta2 agonists are added to an inhaled corticosteroid in patients requiring prophylactic treatment.

The selective beta2 agonists (selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, selective beta2 stimulants) such as salbutamol or terbutaline sulfate are the safest and most effective short-acting beta2 agonists for asthma. Less selective beta2 agonists such as ephedrine hydrochloride is less suitable and less safe for use as a bronchodilator than the selective beta2 agonists, because it is more likely to cause arrhythmias and other side-effects; it should be avoided whenever possible.

Adrenaline/epinephrine (which has both alpha-and beta-adrenoceptor agonist properties) is used in the emergency management of acute allergic and anaphylactic reactions, in angioedema, in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and in the management of severe croup.

Short-acting beta2 agonists

Mild to moderate symptoms of asthma respond rapidly to the inhalation of a selective short-acting beta2 agonist such as salbutamol or terbutaline sulfate. If beta2 agonist inhalation is needed more often than twice a week, or if night-time symptoms occur at least once a week, or if the patient has suffered an exacerbation in the last 2 years, then prophylactic treatment should be considered using a stepped approach.

A short-acting beta2 agonist inhaled immediately before exertion reduces exercise-induced asthma; however, frequent exercise-induced asthma probably reflects poor overall control and calls for reassessment of asthma treatment.

Long-acting beta2 agonists

Formoterol fumarate (eformoterol) and salmeterol are longer-acting beta2 agonists which are administered by inhalation. They should be used for asthma only in patients who regularly use an inhaled corticosteroid. They have a role in the long-term management of chronic asthma and can be useful in nocturnal asthma.

Salmeterol should not be used for the relief of an asthma attack; it has a slower onset of action than salbutamol or terbutaline sulfate. Formoterol fumarate is licensed for short-term symptom relief and for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm; its speed of onset of action is similar to that of salbutamol.

Combination inhalers that contain a long-acting beta2 agonist and a corticosteroid ensure that long-acting beta2 agonists are not used without concomitant corticosteroids, but reduce the flexibility to adjust the dose of each component.

Indacaterol and olodaterol are long-acting beta2 agonists licensed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults; they are not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.

Vilanterol is a long-acting beta2 agonist available only in a combination inhaler with fluticasone furoate or with umeclidinium.

Oral

Oral preparations of beta2 agonists may be used by patients who cannot manage the inhaled route. They are sometimes used for children and the elderly, but inhaled beta2 agonists are more effective and have fewer side-effects. The longer-acting oral preparations, including bambuterol hydrochloride, may be of value in nocturnal asthma but they have a limited role and inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists are usually preferred.

Parenteral

Salbutamol or terbutaline sulfate can be given intravenously for severe or life-threatening acute asthma; patients should be carefully monitored and the dose adjusted according to response and heart rate. The regular use of beta2 agonists by the subcutaneous route is not recommended since the evidence of benefit is uncertain and it may be difficult to withdraw such treatment once started. In adults, beta2 agonists may also be given by intramuscular injection.

Children

Selective beta2 agonists are useful even in children under the age of 18 months. They are most effective by the inhaled route; a pressurised metered-dose inhaler should be used with a spacer device in children under 5 years. A beta2 agonist may also be given by mouth but administration by inhalation is preferred; a long-acting inhaled beta2 agonist may be used where appropriate. In severe attacks nebulisation using a selective beta2 agonist or ipratropium bromide is advisable.

Antimuscarinic bronchodilators

Ipratropium bromide can provide short-term relief in chronic asthma, but short-acting beta2 agonists act more quickly and are preferred. Ipratropium bromide by nebulisation can be added to other standard treatment in life-threatening asthma or if acute asthma fails to improve with standard therapy.

The aerosol inhalation of ipratropium bromide can be used for short-term relief in mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients who are not using a long-acting antimuscarinic drug. Its maximal effect occurs 30–60 minutes after use; its duration of action is 3 to 6 hours and bronchodilation can usually be maintained with treatment 3 times a day.

Aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide, tiotropium, and umeclidinium are licensed for the maintenance treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They are not suitable for the relief of acute bronchospasm. Tiotropium (via Respimat device) is also licensed as an adjunct to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2 agonists for the maintenance treatment of patients with asthma who have suffered one or more severe exacerbations in the last year. 

Theophylline

Theophylline is a xanthine used as a bronchodilator in asthma and stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; it is not generally effective in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Theophylline may have an additive effect when used in conjunction with small doses of beta2 agonists; the combination may increase the risk of side-effects, including hypokalaemia.

Theophylline is given by injection as aminophylline, a mixture of theophylline with ethylenediamine, which is 20 times more soluble than theophylline alone. Aminophylline injection is needed rarely for severe acute asthma.

Compound bronchodilator preparations

In general, patients are best treated with single-ingredient preparations, such as a selective beta2 agonist or ipratropium bromide, so that the dose of each drug can be adjusted. This flexibility is lost with compound bronchodilator preparations. However, a combination product may be appropriate for patients stabilised on individual components in the same proportion.

Calcium-channel blockers differ in their predilection for the various possible sites of action and, therefore, their therapeutic effects are disparate, with much greater variation than those of beta-blockers. There are important differences between verapamil hydrochloride, diltiazem hydrochloride, and the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (amlodipine, felodipine, lacidipine, lercanidipine hydrochloride, nicardipine hydrochloride, nifedipine, and nimodipine). Verapamil hydrochloride and diltiazem hydrochloride should usually be avoided in heart failure because they may further depress cardiac function and cause clinically significant deterioration.

Verapamil hydrochloride is used for the treatment of angina, hypertension, and arrhythmias. It is a highly negatively inotropic calcium channel-blocker and it reduces cardiac output, slows the heart rate, and may impair atrioventricular conduction. It may precipitate heart failure, exacerbate conduction disorders, and cause hypotension at high doses and should not be used with beta-blockers. Constipation is the most common side-effect.

Nifedipine relaxes vascular smooth muscle and dilates coronary and peripheral arteries. It has more influence on vessels and less on the myocardium than does verapamil hydrochloride, and unlike verapamil hydrochloride has no anti-arrhythmic activity. It rarely precipitates heart failure because any negative inotropic effect is offset by a reduction in left ventricular work.

Nicardipine hydrochloride has similar effects to those of nifedipine and may produce less reduction of myocardial contractility. Amlodipine and felodipine also resemble nifedipine and nicardipine hydrochloride in their effects and do not reduce myocardial contractility and they do not produce clinical deterioration in heart failure. They have a longer duration of action and can be given once daily. Nifedipine, nicardipine hydrochloride, amlodipine, and felodipine are used for the treatment of angina or hypertension. All are valuable in forms of angina associated with coronary vasospasm. Side-effects associated with vasodilatation such as flushing and headache (which become less obtrusive after a few days), and ankle swelling (which may respond only partially to diuretics) are common.

Intravenous nicardipine hydrochloride is licensed for the treatment of acute life-threatening hypertension, for example in the event of malignant arterial hypertension or hypertensive encephalopathy; aortic dissection, when a short-acting beta-blocker is not suitable, or in combination with a beta-blocker when beta-blockade alone is not effective; severe pre-eclampsia, when other intravenous anti-hypertensives are not recommended or are contra-indicated; and for treatment of postoperative hypertension. .

Isradipine, lacidipine and lercanidipine hydrochloride have similar effects to those of nifedipine and nicardipine hydrochloride; they are indicated for hypertension only.

Nimodipine is related to nifedipine but the smooth muscle relaxant effect preferentially acts on cerebral arteries. Its use is confined to prevention and treatment of vascular spasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Diltiazem hydrochloride is effective in most forms of angina; the longer-acting formulation is also used for hypertension. It may be used in patients for whom beta-blockers are contra-indicated or ineffective. It has a less negative inotropic effect than verapamil hydrochloride and significant myocardial depression occurs rarely. Nevertheless because of the risk of bradycardia it should be used with caution in association with beta-blockers.

Unstable angina

Calcium-channel blockers do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in unstable angina. The use of diltiazem hydrochloride or verapamil hydrochloride should be reserved for patients resistant to treatment with beta-blockers.

The carbapenems are beta-lactam antibacterials with a broad-spectrum of activity which includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobes; imipenem (imipenem with cilastatin) and meropenem have good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The carbapenems are not active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium.

Imipenem (imipenem with cilastatin) and meropenem are used for the treatment of severe hospital-acquired infections and polymicrobial infections including septicaemia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, skin and soft-tissue infections, and complicated urinary-tract infections.

Ertapenem is licensed for treating abdominal and gynaecological infections and for community-acquired pneumonia, but it is not active against atypical respiratory pathogens and it has limited activity against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. It is also licensed for treating foot infections of the skin and soft tissue in patients with diabetes. Unlike the other carbapenems, ertapenem is not active against Pseudomonas or against Acinetobacter spp.

Imipenem is partially inactivated in the kidney by enzymatic activity and is therefore administered in combination with cilastatin (imipenem with cilastatin), a specific enzyme inhibitor, which blocks its renal metabolism. Meropenem and ertapenem are stable to the renal enzyme which inactivates imipenem and therefore can be given without cilastatin.

Side-effects of imipenem with cilastatin are similar to those of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Meropenem has less seizure-inducing potential and can be used to treat central nervous system infection.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>The cephalosporins are broad-spectrum antibiotics which are used for the treatment of septicaemia, pneumonia, meningitis, biliary-tract infections, peritonitis, and urinary-tract infections. The pharmacology of the cephalosporins is similar to that of the penicillins, excretion being principally renal. Cephalosporins penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid poorly unless the meninges are inflamed; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cefotaxime.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3384\">cefotaxime</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ceftriaxone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3397\">ceftriaxone</xref> are suitable cephalosporins for infections of the CNS (e.g meningitis).</p>

The cephalosporins are broad-spectrum antibiotics which are used for the treatment of septicaemia, pneumonia, meningitis, biliary-tract infections, peritonitis, and urinary-tract infections. The pharmacology of the cephalosporins is similar to that of the penicillins, excretion being principally renal. Cephalosporins penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid poorly unless the meninges are inflamed; cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are suitable cephalosporins for infections of the CNS (e.g meningitis).

The principal side-effect of the cephalosporins is hypersensitivity and about 0.5–6.5% of penicillin-sensitive patients will also be allergic to the cephalosporins. If a cephalosporin is essential in patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin, because a suitable alternative antibacterial is not available, then cefixime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or cefuroxime can be used with caution; cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefradine, and ceftaroline fosamil should be avoided.

The orally active ‘first generation’ cephalosporins, cefalexin, cefradine, and cefadroxil and the ‘second generation’ cephalosporin, cefaclor, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum. They are useful for urinary-tract infections which do not respond to other drugs or which occur in pregnancy, respiratory-tract infections, otitis media, sinusitis, and skin and soft-tissue infections. Cefaclor has good activity against H. influenzae. Cefadroxil has a long duration of action and can be given twice daily; it has poor activity against H. influenzae. Cefuroxime axetil, an ester of the ‘second generation’ cephalosporin cefuroxime, has the same antibacterial spectrum as the parent compound; it is poorly absorbed and needs to be given with food to maximise absorption.

Cefixime is an orally active ‘third generation’ cephalosporin. It has a longer duration of action than the other cephalosporins that are active by mouth. It is only licensed for acute infections.

Cefuroxime is a ‘second generation’ cephalosporin that is less susceptible than the earlier cephalosporins to inactivation by beta-lactamases. It is, therefore, active against certain bacteria which are resistant to the other drugs and has greater activity against Haemophilus influenzae.

Cefotaxime, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone are ‘third generation’ cephalosporins with greater activity than the ‘second generation’ cephalosporins against certain Gram-negative bacteria. However, they are less active than cefuroxime against Gram-positive bacteria, most notably Staphylococcus aureus. Their broad antibacterial spectrum may encourage superinfection with resistant bacteria or fungi.

Ceftazidime has good activity against pseudomonas. It is also active against other Gram-negative bacteria.

Ceftriaxone has a longer half-life and therefore needs to be given only once daily. Indications include serious infections such as septicaemia, pneumonia, and meningitis. The calcium salt of ceftriaxone forms a precipitate in the gall bladder which may rarely cause symptoms but these usually resolve when the antibiotic is stopped.

Ceftaroline fosamil is a ‘fifth generation’ cephalosporin with bactericidal activity similar to cefotaxime; however, ceftaroline fosamil has an extended spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria that includes meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ceftaroline fosamil is licensed for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and soft-tissue infections, but there is no experience of its use in pneumonia caused by meticillin-resistant S. aureus.

Once tumours are ruled out individual symptoms of chronic bowel disorders need specific treatment including dietary manipulation as well as drug treatment and the maintenance of a liberal fluid intake.

Clostridium difficile infection

Clostridium difficile infection is caused by colonisation of the colon with Clostridium difficile and production of toxin. It often follows antibiotic therapy and is usually of acute onset, but may become chronic. It is a particular hazard of ampicillin, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, second- and third-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, and quinolones, but few antibiotics are free of this side-effect. Treatment options include metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin.

Diverticular disease

Diverticular disease is treated with a high-fibre diet, bran supplements, and bulk-forming drugs. Antispasmodics may provide symptomatic relief when colic is a problem. Antibacterials are used only when the diverticula in the intestinal wall become infected. Antimotility drugs which slow intestinal motility, e.g. codeine phosphate, co-phenotrope (diphenoxylate with atropine), and loperamide hydrochloride could possibly exacerbate the symptoms of diverticular disease and are contra-indicated.

Irritable bowel syndrome

Irritable bowel syndrome can present with pain, constipation, or diarrhoea. In some patients there may be important psychological aggravating factors which respond to reassurance and possibly specific treatment e.g. with an antidepressant.

The fibre intake of patients with irritable bowel syndrome should be reviewed. If an increase in dietary fibre is required, soluble fibre (e.g. ispaghula husk, sterculia, or oats) is recommended; insoluble fibre (e.g. bran) may exacerbate symptoms and its use should be discouraged. A laxative can be used to treat constipation. An osmotic laxative, such as a macrogol, is preferred; lactulose may cause bloating. Linaclotide is licensed for the treatment of moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome associated with constipation. Stimulant laxatives should be avoided or used only occasionally. Loperamide hydrochloride may relieve diarrhoea and antispasmodic drugs may relieve pain. Opioids with a central action, such as codeine phosphate, are better avoided because of the risk of dependence.

A tricyclic antidepressant can be used for abdominal pain or discomfort [unlicensed indication] in patients who have not responded to laxatives, loperamide hydrochloride, or antispasmodics. A selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor may be considered in those who do not respond to a tricyclic antidepressant [unlicensed indication].

Malabsorption syndromes

Individual conditions need specific management and also general nutritional consideration. Coeliac disease (gluten enteropathy) usually needs a gluten-free diet and pancreatic insufficiency needs pancreatin supplements.

Smoking cessation reduces the progressive decline in lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema). Infection can complicate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may be prevented by vaccination (pneumococcal vaccine and influenza vaccine).

A trial of a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid or an oral corticosteroid is recommended for patients with moderate or severe airflow obstruction if the diagnosis is in doubt.

Symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be alleviated by an inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist or a short-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilator used as required.

When the airways obstruction is more severe, regular inhaled therapy should be used. It is important to check compliance and inhaler technique before initiating a new drug.

If the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), is 50% of predicted or more, either a long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilator or a long-acting beta2 agonist should be used. Short-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilators should be discontinued when a long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilator is started. A long-acting beta2 agonist with a corticosteroid in a combination inhaler can be used for patients who remain symptomatic despite regular treatment with a long-acting beta2 agonist.

If FEV1 is less than 50% of predicted, either a long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilator or a long-acting beta2 agonist with a corticosteroid in a combination inhaler should be used.

In any patient who remains breathless or continues to have exacerbations, triple therapy with a long-acting beta2 agonist and a corticosteroid in a combination inhaler plus a long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilator should be used.

If an inhaled corticosteroid is not appropriate, a long-acting antimuscarinic bronchodilator can be used with a long-acting beta2 agonist, (see Use of inhaled therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease algorithm, below).

If symptoms persist or if the patient is unable to use an inhaler, oral modified-release aminophylline or theophylline can be used.

Indacaterol is a long-acting beta2 agonist licensed for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of frequent exacerbations, roflumilast is licensed as an adjunct to existing bronchodilator treatment.

A mucolytic drug may be considered for a patient with a chronic productive cough.

Long-term oxygen therapy prolongs survival in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypoxaemia.

During an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchodilator therapy can be administered through a nebuliser if necessary and oxygen given if appropriate. Aminophylline can be given intravenously if response to nebulised bronchodilators is poor. A short course of oral corticosteroid, such as prednisolone for 7–14 days, should be given if increased breathlessness interferes with daily activities. Antibacterial treatment is required if sputum becomes more purulent than usual, or if there are other signs of infection.

Patients who have had an episode of hypercapnic respiratory failure should be given a 24% or 28% Venturi mask and an oxygen alert card endorsed with the oxygen saturations required during previous exacerbations. Patients and their carers should be instructed to show the card to emergency healthcare providers in the event of an exacerbation.

    <p>Before prescribing laxatives it is important to be sure that the patient <i>is</i> constipated and that the constipation is <i>not</i> secondary to an underlying undiagnosed complaint.</p>
    <p>It is also important for those who complain of constipation to understand that bowel habit can vary considerably in frequency without doing harm. Some people tend to consider themselves constipated if they do not have a bowel movement each day. A useful definition of constipation is the passage of hard stools less frequently than the patient's own normal pattern and this can be explained to the patient.</p>
    <p>Misconceptions about bowel habits have led to excessive laxative use. Abuse may lead to hypokalaemia.</p>
    <p>Thus, laxatives should generally be <b>avoided</b> except where straining will exacerbate a condition (such as angina) or increase the risk of rectal bleeding as in haemorrhoids. Laxatives are also of value in <i>drug-induced constipation</i>, for the expulsion of <i>parasites</i> after anthelmintic treatment, and to clear the alimentary tract <i>before surgery and radiological procedures</i>.

Misconceptions about bowel habits have led to excessive laxative use. Abuse may lead to hypokalaemia.

Thus, laxatives should generally be avoided except where straining will exacerbate a condition (such as angina) or increase the risk of rectal bleeding as in haemorrhoids. Laxatives are also of value in drug-induced constipation, for the expulsion of parasites after anthelmintic treatment, and to clear the alimentary tract before surgery and radiological procedures. Prolonged treatment of constipation is sometimes necessary.

Laxatives also have a role in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

Also see the prevention of opioid-induced constipation in palliative care.

The laxatives that follow have been divided into 5 main groups. This simple classification disguises the fact that some laxatives have a complex action.

Bulk-forming laxatives

Bulk-forming laxatives are of value if the diet is deficient in fibre. Bulk-forming laxatives are of particular value in those with small hard stools, but should not be required unless fibre cannot be increased in the diet. A balanced diet, including adequate fluid intake and fibre is of value in preventing constipation.

Bulk-forming laxatives can be used in the management of patients with colostomy, ileostomy, haemorrhoids, anal fissure, chronic diarrhoea associated with diverticular disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and as adjuncts in ulcerative colitis. Adequate fluid intake must be maintained to avoid intestinal obstruction. Unprocessed wheat bran, taken with food or fruit juice, is a most effective bulk-forming preparation. Finely ground bran, though more palatable, has poorer water-retaining properties, but can be taken as bran bread or biscuits in appropriately increased quantities. Oat bran is also used. 

Methylcellulose, ispaghula husk, and sterculia are useful in patients who cannot tolerate bran. Methylcellulose also acts as a faecal softener.

Stimulant laxatives

Stimulant laxatives include bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, and members of the anthraquinone group, senna, co-danthramer and co-danthrusate. The indications for co-danthramer and co-danthrusate are limited by its potential carcinogenicity (based on rodent carcinogenicity studies) and evidence of genotoxicity. Powerful stimulants such as cascara (an anthraquinone) and castor oil are obsolete. Docusate sodium probably acts both as a stimulant and as a softening agent.

Stimulant laxatives increase intestinal motility and often cause abdominal cramp; they should be avoided in intestinal obstruction. Excessive use of stimulant laxatives can cause diarrhoea and related effects such as hypokalaemia; however, prolonged use may be justifiable in some circumstances.

Glycerol suppositories act as a lubricant and as a rectal stimulant by virtue of the mildly irritant action of glycerol.

Unstandardised preparations of cascara, frangula, rhubarb, and senna should be avoided as their laxative action is unpredictable. Aloes, colocynth, and jalap should be avoided as they have a drastic purgative action.

The parasympathomimetics bethanechol chloride, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine bromide enhance parasympathetic activity in the gut and increase intestinal motility. They are rarely used for their gastro-intestinal effects. Organic obstruction of the gut must first be excluded and they should not be used shortly after bowel anastomosis.

Other stimulant laxatives

Unstandardised preparations of cascara, frangula, rhubarb, and senna should be avoided as their laxative action is unpredictable. Aloes, colocynth, and jalap should be avoided as they have a drastic purgative action.

Faecal softeners

Liquid paraffin, the traditional lubricant, has disadvantages. Bulk laxatives and non-ionic surfactant ‘wetting’ agents e.g. docusate sodium also have softening properties. Such drugs are useful for oral administration in the management of haemorrhoids and anal fissure; glycerol is useful for rectal use.

Enemas containing arachis oil (ground-nut oil, peanut oil) lubricate and soften impacted faeces and promote a bowel movement.

Osmotic laxatives

Osmotic laxatives increase the amount of water in the large bowel, either by drawing fluid from the body into the bowel or by retaining the fluid they were administered with.

Lactulose is a semi-synthetic disaccharide which is not absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. It produces an osmotic diarrhoea of low faecal pH, and discourages the proliferation of ammonia-producing organisms. It is therefore useful in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.

Macrogols are inert polymers of ethylene glycol which sequester fluid in the bowel; giving fluid with macrogols may reduce the dehydrating effect sometimes seen with osmotic laxatives.

Saline purgatives such as magnesium hydroxide are commonly abused but are satisfactory for occasional use; adequate fluid intake should be maintained. Magnesium salts, such as magnesium sulfate are useful where rapid bowel evacuation is required. Sodium salts should be avoided as they may give rise to sodium and water retention in susceptible individuals. Phosphate enemas are useful in bowel clearance before radiology, endoscopy, and surgery.

Other drugs used in constipation

Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist that is licensed for the treatment of moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome associated with constipation. It increases intestinal fluid secretion and transit, and decreases visceral pain. It is metabolised within the gastro-intestinal tract and is virtually undetectable in the plasma after therapeutic doses.

Lubiprostone is a chloride-channel activator that is licensed for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults whose condition has not responded adequately to lifestyle changes (including dietary changes).

Prucalopride is a selective serotonin 5HT4-receptor agonist with prokinetic properties. It is licensed for the treatment of chronic constipation in women, when other laxatives have failed to provide an adequate response.

Bowel cleansing preparations

Bowel cleansing preparations are used before colonic surgery, colonoscopy, or radiological examination to ensure the bowel is free of solid contents. They are not treatments for constipation.

Pregnancy

If dietary and lifestyle changes fail to control constipation in pregnancy, moderate doses of poorly absorbed laxatives may be used. A bulk-forming laxative should be tried first. An osmotic laxative, such as lactulose, can also be used. Bisacodyl or senna may be suitable, if a stimulant effect is necessary.

    <p>Laxatives should be prescribed by a healthcare professional experienced in the management of constipation in children. Delays of greater than 3 days between stools may increase the likelihood of pain on passing hard stools leading to anal fissure, anal spasm and eventually to a learned response to avoid defaecation.</p>
    <p>In <i>infants</i>, increased intake of fluids, particularly fruit juice containing sorbitol (e.g. prune, pear, or apple), may be sufficient to soften the stool. In infants under 1 year of age with mild constipation, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/lactulose.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP613\">lactulose</xref> can be used to soften the stool; either an oral preparation containing macrogols or, rarely, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glycerol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP586\">glycerol</xref> suppositories can be used to clear faecal impaction. The infant should be referred to a hospital paediatric specialist if these measures fail.</p>
    <p>The diet of <i>children over 1 year of age</i> should be reviewed to ensure that it includes an adequate intake of fibre and fluid. An osmotic laxative containing macrogols can also be used, particularly in children with chronic constipation; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/lactulose.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP613\">lactulose</xref> is an alternative in children who cannot tolerate a macrogol. If there is an inadequate response to the osmotic laxative, a <b>stimulant laxative</b> can be added.</p>
    <p>Treatment of faecal impaction may initially increase symptoms of soiling and abdominal pain. In children over 1 year of age with faecal impaction, an oral preparation containing macrogols is used to clear faecal mass and to establish and maintain soft well-formed stools. If disimpaction does not occur after 2 weeks, a <b>stimulant laxative</b> can be added. If the impacted mass is not expelled following treatment with macrogols and a stimulant laxative, a sodium citrate enema can be administered. Although rectal administration of laxatives may be effective, this route is frequently distressing for the child and may lead to persistence of withholding. A <b>phosphate enema</b> may be administered under specialist supervision if disimpaction does not occur after a sodium citrate enema; a <b>bowel cleansing preparation</b> is an alternative. Manual evacuation under anaesthetic may be necessary if disimpaction does not occur after oral and rectal treatment, or if the child is afraid.</p>
    <p>Long-term regular use of laxatives is essential to maintain well-formed stools and prevent recurrence of faecal impaction; intermittent use may provoke relapses. In children with chronic constipation, laxatives should be continued for several weeks after a regular pattern of bowel movements or toilet training is established. The dose of laxatives should then be tapered gradually, over a period of months, according to response. Some children may require laxative therapy for several years.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Chronic constipation</p>
      <p>For children with chronic constipation, it may be necessary to exceed the licensed doses of some laxatives. Parents and carers of children should be advised to adjust the dose of laxative in order to establish a regular pattern of bowel movements in which stools are soft, well-formed, and passed without discomfort. Laxatives should be administered at a time that produces an effect that is likely to fit in with the child's toilet routine.</p>

In infants under 1 year of age with mild constipation, lactulose can be used to soften the stool; either an oral preparation containing macrogols or, rarely, glycerol suppositories can be used to clear faecal impaction. The infant should be referred to a hospital paediatric specialist if these measures fail.

The diet of children over 1 year of age should be reviewed to ensure that it includes an adequate intake of fibre and fluid. An osmotic laxative containing macrogols can also be used, particularly in children with chronic constipation; lactulose is an alternative in children who cannot tolerate a macrogol. If there is an inadequate response to the osmotic laxative, a stimulant laxative can be added.

Treatment of faecal impaction may initially increase symptoms of soiling and abdominal pain. In children over 1 year of age with faecal impaction, an oral preparation containing macrogols is used to clear faecal mass and to establish and maintain soft well-formed stools. If disimpaction does not occur after 2 weeks, a stimulant laxative can be added. If the impacted mass is not expelled following treatment with macrogols and a stimulant laxative, a sodium citrate enema can be administered. Although rectal administration of laxatives may be effective, this route is frequently distressing for the child and may lead to persistence of withholding. A phosphate enema may be administered under specialist supervision if disimpaction does not occur after a sodium citrate enema; a bowel cleansing preparation is an alternative. Manual evacuation under anaesthetic may be necessary if disimpaction does not occur after oral and rectal treatment, or if the child is afraid.

Long-term regular use of laxatives is essential to maintain well-formed stools and prevent recurrence of faecal impaction; intermittent use may provoke relapses. In children with chronic constipation, laxatives should be continued for several weeks after a regular pattern of bowel movements or toilet training is established. The dose of laxatives should then be tapered gradually, over a period of months, according to response. Some children may require laxative therapy for several years.

Chronic constipation

For children with chronic constipation, it may be necessary to exceed the licensed doses of some laxatives. Parents and carers of children should be advised to adjust the dose of laxative in order to establish a regular pattern of bowel movements in which stools are soft, well-formed, and passed without discomfort. Laxatives should be administered at a time that produces an effect that is likely to fit in with the child's toilet routine.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>The Fraser Guidelines (Department of Health Guidance (July 2004): Best practice guidance for doctors and other health professionals on the provision of advice and treatment to young people under 16 on contraception, sexual and reproductive health, available at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/bpg16\">www.tinyurl.com/bpg16</xref>) should be followed when prescribing contraception for women under 16 years. The UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (available at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.fsrh.org\">www.fsrh.org</xref>) is published by the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare; it categorises the risks of using contraceptive methods with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Hormonal contraception</b> is the most effective method of fertility control, but can have major and minor side-effects, especially for certain groups of women. Hormonal contraception should only be used by adolescents after menarche.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Intra-uterine devices</b> are a highly effective method of contraception but may produce undesirable local side-effects. They may be used in women of all ages irrespective of parity, but are less appropriate for those with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Barrier methods</b> alone (condoms, diaphragms, and caps) are less effective but can be reliable for well-motivated couples if used in conjunction with a <b>spermicide</b>. Occasionally sensitivity reactions occur. A female condom (<i>Femidom</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) is also available; it is pre-lubricated but does not contain a spermicide.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Combined hormonal contraceptives</p>
    <p>Oral contraceptives containing an oestrogen and a progestogen (‘combined oral contraceptives’) are effective preparations for general use. Advantages of combined oral contraceptives include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>reliable and reversible;</li>
      <li>reduced dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia;</li>
      <li>reduced incidence of premenstrual tension;</li>
      <li>less symptomatic fibroids and functional ovarian cysts;</li>
      <li>less benign breast disease;</li>
      <li>reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer;</li>
      <li>reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Combined oral contraceptives containing a fixed amount of an oestrogen and a progestogen in each active tablet are termed ‘monophasic’; those with varying amounts of the two hormones are termed ‘phasic’. A transdermal patch and a vaginal ring, both containing an oestrogen with a progestogen, are also available.</p>

      <p>Oestrogen-containing contraceptives should preferably be discontinued (and adequate alternative contraceptive arrangements made) 4 weeks before major elective surgery and all surgery to the legs or surgery which involves prolonged immobilisation of a lower limb; they should normally be recommenced at the first menses occurring at least 2 weeks after full mobilisation. A progestogen-only contraceptive may be offered as an alternative and the oestrogen-containing contraceptive restarted after mobilisation. When discontinuation of an oestrogen-containing contraceptive is not possible, e.g. after trauma or if a patient admitted for an elective procedure is still on an oestrogen- containing contraceptive, thromboprophylaxis (with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin and graduated compression hosiery) is advised. These recommendations do not apply to minor surgery with short duration of anaesthesia, e.g. laparoscopic sterilisation or tooth extraction, or to women using oestrogen-free hormonal contraceptives.</p>

      <p>Oral progestogen-only preparations alter cervical mucus to prevent sperm penetration and may inhibit ovulation in some women; oral desogestrel-only preparations consistently inhibit ovulation and this is their primary mechanism of action. There is insufficient clinical trial evidence to compare the efficacy of oral progestogen-only contraceptives with each other or with combined hormonal contraceptives. Progestogen-only contraceptives offer a suitable alternative to combined hormonal contraceptives when oestrogens are contra-indicated (including those with venous thrombosis or a past history or predisposition to venous thrombosis, heavy smokers, those with hypertension above systolic 160 mmHg or diastolic 95 mmHg, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus with complications, and migraine with aura).</p>

It may be used as a short-term or long-term contraceptive for women who have been counselled about the likelihood of menstrual disturbance and the potential for a delay in return to full fertility. Delayed return of fertility and irregular cycles may occur after discontinuation of treatment but there is no evidence of permanent infertility. Troublesome bleeding has been reported in patients given <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/medroxyprogesterone-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4491\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</xref> in the immediate puerperium; delaying the first injection until 6 weeks after birth may minimise bleeding problems.

      <b>Norethisterone enantate</b> (<i>Noristerat</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) is a long-acting progestogen given as an oily injection which provides contraception for 8 weeks; it is used as short-term interim contraception e.g. before vasectomy becomes effective.</p>
    <p>An <b>etonogestrel-releasing implant</b> (<i>Nexplanon</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) is also available. It is a highly effective long-acting contraceptive, consisting of a single flexible rod that is inserted subdermally into the lower surface of the upper arm and provides contraception for up to 3 years. The manufacturer advises that in heavier women, blood-etonogestrel concentrations are lower and therefore the implant may not provide effective contraception during the third year; they advise that earlier replacement may be considered in such patients—however, evidence to support this recommendation is lacking. Local reactions such as bruising and itching can occur at the insertion site. The contraceptive effect of etonogestrel is rapidly reversed on removal of the implant.</p>

These may therefore be a contraceptive method of choice for women who have excessively heavy menses.</p>
      <p>The effects of the progestogen-only intra-uterine system are mainly local and hormonal including prevention of endometrial proliferation, thickening of cervical mucus, and suppression of ovulation in some women (in some cycles). In addition to the progestogenic activity, the intra-uterine system itself may contribute slightly to the contraceptive effect. Return of fertility after removal is rapid and appears to be complete.</p>
      <p>Advantages of the progestogen-only intra-uterine system over copper intra-uterine devices are that there may be an improvement in any dysmenorrhoea and a reduction in blood loss; there is also evidence that the frequency of pelvic inflammatory disease may be reduced (particularly in the youngest age groups who are most at risk).</p>
      <p>In primary menorrhagia, menstrual bleeding is reduced significantly within 3–6 months of inserting the progestogen-only intra-uterine system, probably because it prevents endometrial proliferation. Another treatment should be considered if menorrhagia does not improve within this time.</p>

The Fraser Guidelines (Department of Health Guidance (July 2004): Best practice guidance for doctors and other health professionals on the provision of advice and treatment to young people under 16 on contraception, sexual and reproductive health, available at www.tinyurl.com/bpg16) should be followed when prescribing contraception for women under 16 years. The UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (available at www.fsrh.org) is published by the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare; it categorises the risks of using contraceptive methods with pre-existing medical conditions.

Hormonal contraception is the most effective method of fertility control, but can have major and minor side-effects, especially for certain groups of women. Hormonal contraception should only be used by adolescents after menarche.

Intra-uterine devices are a highly effective method of contraception but may produce undesirable local side-effects. They may be used in women of all ages irrespective of parity, but are less appropriate for those with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Barrier methods alone (condoms, diaphragms, and caps) are less effective but can be reliable for well-motivated couples if used in conjunction with a spermicide. Occasionally sensitivity reactions occur. A female condom (Femidom) is also available; it is pre-lubricated but does not contain a spermicide.

Combined hormonal contraceptives

Oral contraceptives containing an oestrogen and a progestogen (‘combined oral contraceptives’) are effective preparations for general use. Advantages of combined oral contraceptives include:

reliable and reversible;reduced dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia;reduced incidence of premenstrual tension;less symptomatic fibroids and functional ovarian cysts;less benign breast disease;reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer;reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.Combined oral contraceptives containing a fixed amount of an oestrogen and a progestogen in each active tablet are termed ‘monophasic’; those with varying amounts of the two hormones are termed ‘phasic’. A transdermal patch and a vaginal ring, both containing an oestrogen with a progestogen, are also available.

The majority of combined oral contraceptives contain ethinylestradiol as the oestrogen component; mestranol and estradiol are also used. The ethinylestradiol content of combined oral contraceptives ranges from 20 to 40 micrograms. Generally a preparation with the lowest oestrogen and progestogen content which gives good cycle control and minimal side-effects in the individual woman is chosen. It is recommended that combined hormonal contraceptives are not continued beyond 50 years of age since more suitable alternatives exist.

Low strength preparations (containing ethinylestradiol 20 micrograms) are particularly appropriate for women with risk factors for circulatory disease, provided a combined oral contraceptive is otherwise suitable.Standard strength preparations (containing ethinylestradiol 30 or 35 micrograms or in 30–40 microgram phased  preparations) are appropriate for standard use. Phased preparations are generally reserved for women who either do not have withdrawal bleeding or who have breakthrough bleeding with monophasic products.The progestogens ethinylestradiol with desogestrel, ethinylestradiol with drospirenone, and ethinylestradiol with gestodene may be considered for women who have side-effects (such as acne, headache, depression, breast symptoms, and breakthrough bleeding) with other progestogens. Drospirenone, a derivative of spironolactone, has anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid activity; it should be used with care if an increased plasma-potassium concentration might be hazardous.

Dienogest with estradiol valerate is in the combined oral contraceptive Qlaira. Nomegestrol is the progestogen contained in the combined oral contraceptive Zoely, in combination with estradiol.

The progestogen norelgestromin is combined with ethinylestradiol in a transdermal patch (Evra). The vaginal contraceptive ring contains the progestogen etonogestrel combined with ethinylestradiol (NuvaRing).

Surgery

Oestrogen-containing contraceptives should preferably be discontinued (and adequate alternative contraceptive arrangements made) 4 weeks before major elective surgery and all surgery to the legs or surgery which involves prolonged immobilisation of a lower limb; they should normally be recommenced at the first menses occurring at least 2 weeks after full mobilisation. A progestogen-only contraceptive may be offered as an alternative and the oestrogen-containing contraceptive restarted after mobilisation. When discontinuation of an oestrogen-containing contraceptive is not possible, e.g. after trauma or if a patient admitted for an elective procedure is still on an oestrogen- containing contraceptive, thromboprophylaxis (with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin and graduated compression hosiery) is advised. These recommendations do not apply to minor surgery with short duration of anaesthesia, e.g. laparoscopic sterilisation or tooth extraction, or to women using oestrogen-free hormonal contraceptives.

Reason to stop immediately

Combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be stopped (pending investigation and treatment), if any of the following occur:

sudden severe chest pain (even if not radiating to left arm);sudden breathlessness (or cough with blood-stained sputum);unexplained swelling or severe pain in calf of one leg;severe stomach pain;serious neurological effects including unusual severe, prolonged headache especially if first time or getting progressively worse or sudden partial or complete loss of vision or sudden disturbance of hearing or other perceptual disorders or dysphasia or bad fainting attack or collapse or first unexplained epileptic seizure or weakness, motor disturbances, very marked numbness suddenly affecting one side or one part of body;hepatitis, jaundice, liver enlargement;blood pressure above systolic 160 mmHg or diastolic 95 mmHg; (in adolescents stop if blood pressure very high);prolonged immobility after surgery or leg injury;detection of a risk factor which contra-indicates treatment.Progestogen-only contraceptives

Oral progestogen-only contraceptives

Oral progestogen-only preparations alter cervical mucus to prevent sperm penetration and may inhibit ovulation in some women; oral desogestrel-only preparations consistently inhibit ovulation and this is their primary mechanism of action. There is insufficient clinical trial evidence to compare the efficacy of oral progestogen-only contraceptives with each other or with combined hormonal contraceptives. Progestogen-only contraceptives offer a suitable alternative to combined hormonal contraceptives when oestrogens are contra-indicated (including those with venous thrombosis or a past history or predisposition to venous thrombosis, heavy smokers, those with hypertension above systolic 160 mmHg or diastolic 95 mmHg, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus with complications, and migraine with aura).

Parenteral progestogen-only contraceptives

Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera, SAYANA PRESS) is a long-acting progestogen given by injection; it is at least as effective as the combined oral preparations but because of its prolonged action it should never be given without full counselling backed by the patient information leaflet. It may be used as a short-term or long-term contraceptive for women who have been counselled about the likelihood of menstrual disturbance and the potential for a delay in return to full fertility. Delayed return of fertility and irregular cycles may occur after discontinuation of treatment but there is no evidence of permanent infertility. Troublesome bleeding has been reported in patients given medroxyprogesterone acetate in the immediate puerperium; delaying the first injection until 6 weeks after birth may minimise bleeding problems. If the woman is not breast-feeding, the first injection may be given within 5 days postpartum (she should be warned that the risk of troublesome bleeding may be increased).

In adolescents, medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo- Provera, SAYANA PRESS) should be used only when other methods of contraception are inappropriate;in all women, the benefits of using medroxyprogesterone acetate beyond 2 years should be evaluated against the risks;in women with risk factors for osteoporosis, a method of contraception other than medroxyprogesterone acetate should be considered.Norethisterone enantate (Noristerat) is a long-acting progestogen given as an oily injection which provides contraception for 8 weeks; it is used as short-term interim contraception e.g. before vasectomy becomes effective.

An etonogestrel-releasing implant (Nexplanon) is also available. It is a highly effective long-acting contraceptive, consisting of a single flexible rod that is inserted subdermally into the lower surface of the upper arm and provides contraception for up to 3 years. The manufacturer advises that in heavier women, blood-etonogestrel concentrations are lower and therefore the implant may not provide effective contraception during the third year; they advise that earlier replacement may be considered in such patients—however, evidence to support this recommendation is lacking. Local reactions such as bruising and itching can occur at the insertion site. The contraceptive effect of etonogestrel is rapidly reversed on removal of the implant.

Intra-uterine progestogen-only device

The progestogen-only intra-uterine systems Mirena, Jaydess and Levosert release levonorgestrel directly into the uterine cavity. Mirena is licensed for use as a contraceptive, for the treatment of primary menorrhagia and for the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia during oestrogen replacement therapy. Jaydess and Levosert are licensed for contraception, and Levosert is additionally licensed for the treatment of menorrhagia. These may therefore be a contraceptive method of choice for women who have excessively heavy menses.

The effects of the progestogen-only intra-uterine system are mainly local and hormonal including prevention of endometrial proliferation, thickening of cervical mucus, and suppression of ovulation in some women (in some cycles). In addition to the progestogenic activity, the intra-uterine system itself may contribute slightly to the contraceptive effect. Return of fertility after removal is rapid and appears to be complete.

Advantages of the progestogen-only intra-uterine system over copper intra-uterine devices are that there may be an improvement in any dysmenorrhoea and a reduction in blood loss; there is also evidence that the frequency of pelvic inflammatory disease may be reduced (particularly in the youngest age groups who are most at risk).

In primary menorrhagia, menstrual bleeding is reduced significantly within 3–6 months of inserting the progestogen-only intra-uterine system, probably because it prevents endometrial proliferation. Another treatment should be considered if menorrhagia does not improve within this time.

Surgery

All progestogen-only contraceptives (including those given by injection) are suitable for use as an alternative to combined hormonal contraceptives before major elective surgery, before all surgery to the legs, or before surgery which involves prolonged immobilisation of a lower limb.

Emergency contraception

Hormonal methods

Hormonal emergency contraceptives include levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate; either drug should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse to increase efficacy.

Levonorgestrel is effective if taken within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected intercourse and may also be used between 72 and 96 hours after unprotected intercourse [unlicensed use], but efficacy decreases with time. Ulipristal acetate, a progesterone receptor modulator, is effective if taken within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected intercourse.

Levonorgestrel is less effective than insertion of an intra-uterine device. Ulipristal acetate is as effective as levonorgestrel, but its efficacy compared to an intrauterine device is not yet known.

Intra–uterine device

Insertion of an intra-uterine device is more effective than oral levonorgestrel for emergency contraception. A copper intra-uterine contraceptive device can be inserted up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse; sexually transmitted infections should be tested for and insertion of the device should usually be covered by antibacterial prophylaxis (e.g. azithromycin). If intercourse has occurred more than 5 days previously, the device can still be inserted up to 5 days after the earliest likely calculated ovulation (i.e. within the minimum period before implantation), regardless of the number of episodes of unprotected intercourse earlier in the cycle.

      <li>
        <p>For a <i>short course (2 months or less) of an enzyme-inducing drug</i>, continue with a combined oral contraceptive providing ethinylestradiol 30 micrograms or more daily and use a ‘tricycling’ regimen (i.e. taking 3 packets of monophasic tablets without a break followed by a shortened tablet-free interval of 4 days [unlicensed use]).

The effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives, progestogen-only oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches, and vaginal rings can be considerably reduced by interaction with drugs that induce hepatic enzyme activity (e.g. carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, ritonavir, St. John's Wort, topiramate and, above all, rifabutin and rifampicin). A condom together with a long-acting method, such as an injectable contraceptive, may be more suitable for patients with HIV infection or at risk of HIV infection; advice on the possibility of interaction with antiretroviral drugs should be sought from HIV specialists.

Women taking combined hormonal contraceptives who require enzyme-inducing drugs should be advised to change to a contraceptive method that is unaffected by enzyme-inducers (e.g. some parenteral progestogen-only contraceptives, intra-uterine devices) for the duration of treatment and for 4 weeks after stopping.

Contraceptive patches and vaginal rings are not recommended for women taking enzyme-inducing drugs over a long period.

For a long-term course (over 2 months) of rifampicin or rifabutin, an alternative method of contraception (such as an IUD) is always recommended because they are such potent enzyme-inducing drugs; the alternative method of contraception should be continued for 4 weeks after stopping the enzyme-inducing drug.Antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes

Latest recommendations are that no additional contraceptive precautions are required when combined oral contraceptives are used with antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes, unless diarrhoea or vomiting occur. These recommendations should be discussed with the woman, who should also be advised that guidance in patient information leaflets may differ.

It is also currently recommended that no additional contraceptive precautions are required when contraceptive patches or vaginal rings are used with antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes. There have been concerns that some antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes (e.g. ampicillin, doxycycline) reduce the efficacy of combined oral contraceptives by impairing the bacterial flora responsible for recycling ethinylestradiol from the large bowel. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this interaction.

Oral progestogen-only contraceptives interactions

Effectiveness of oral progestogen-only preparations is not affected by antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes. The efficacy of oral progestogen-only preparations is, however, reduced by enzyme-inducing drugs and an alternative contraceptive method, unaffected by the interacting drug, is recommended during treatment with an enzyme-inducing drug and for at least 4 weeks afterwards. For a short course of an enzyme-inducing drug, if a change in contraceptive method is undesirable or inappropriate, the progestogen-only oral method may be continued in combination with additional contraceptive precautions (e.g. barrier methods) for the duration of treatment with the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4 weeks after stopping.

Parenteral progestogen-only contraceptives interactions

Effectiveness of parenteral progestogen-only contraceptives is not affected by antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes. The effectiveness of norethisterone intramuscular injection and medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscular and subcutaneous injections is not affected by enzyme-inducing drugs and they may be continued as normal during courses of these drugs. However, effectiveness of the etonogestrel-releasing implant may be reduced by enzyme-inducing drugs and an alternative contraceptive method, unaffected by the interacting drug, is recommended during treatment with the enzyme-inducing drug and for at least 4 weeks after stopping. For a short course of an enzyme-inducing drug, if a change in contraceptive method is undesirable or inappropriate, the implant may be continued in combination with additional contraceptive precautions (e.g. condom) for the duration of treatment with the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4 weeks after stopping it.

Hormonal emergency contraception interactions

The effectiveness of levonorgestrel, and possibly ulipristal acetate, is reduced in women taking enzyme-inducing drugs (and possibly for 4 weeks after stopping); a copper intra-uterine device can be offered instead. If the copper intra-uterine device is undesirable or inappropriate, the dose of levonorgestrel should be increased to a total of 3 mg taken as a single dose [unlicensed dose—advise women accordingly]. There is no need to increase the dose for emergency contraception if the patient is taking antibacterials that are not enzyme inducers.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Dosages of corticosteroids vary widely in different diseases and in different patients. If the use of a corticosteroid can save or prolong life, as in exfoliative dermatitis, pemphigus, acute leukaemia or acute transplant rejection, high doses may need to be given, because the complications of therapy are likely to be less serious than the effects of the disease itself.</p>
    <p>When long-term corticosteroid therapy is used in some chronic diseases, the adverse effects of treatment may become greater than the disabilities caused by the disease. To minimise side-effects the maintenance dose should be kept as low as possible.</p>
    <p>When potentially less harmful measures are ineffective corticosteroids are used topically for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the skin. Corticosteroids should be avoided or used only under specialist supervision in psoriasis.</p>
    <p>Corticosteroids are used both topically (by rectum) and systemically (by mouth or intravenously) in the management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. They are also included in locally applied creams for haemorrhoids.</p>
    <p>Use can be made of the mineralocorticoid activity of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fludrocortisone-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4328\">fludrocortisone acetate</xref> to treat postural hypotension in autonomic neuropathy.</p>
    <p>High-dose corticosteroids should be avoided for the management of septic shock. However, there is evidence that administration of lower doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydrocortisone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP515\">hydrocortisone</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fludrocortisone-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4328\">fludrocortisone acetate</xref> is of benefit in adrenocortical insufficiency resulting from septic shock.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">Dexamethasone</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/betamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4357\">betamethasone</xref> have little if any mineralocorticoid action and their long duration of action makes them particularly suitable for suppressing corticotropin secretion in congenital adrenal hyperplasia where the dose should be tailored to clinical response and by measurement of adrenal androgens and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In common with all glucocorticoids their suppressive action on the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis is greatest and most prolonged when they are given at night. In most individuals a single dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">dexamethasone</xref> at night, is sufficient to inhibit corticotropin secretion for 24 hours. This is the basis of the ‘overnight <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">dexamethasone</xref> suppression test’ for diagnosing Cushing’s syndrome.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/betamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4357\">Betamethasone</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">dexamethasone</xref> are also appropriate for conditions where water retention would be a disadvantage.</p>
    <p>A corticosteroid may be used in the management of raised intracranial pressure or cerebral oedema that occurs as a result of malignancy (see <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"guidance/PHP107735.xml\" type=\"bookmark\" rel=\"guidance\" bnfid=\"PHP107735\">Prescribing in palliative care</xref>); high doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/betamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4357\">betamethasone</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">dexamethasone</xref> are generally used. However, a corticosteroid should not be used for the management of head injury or stroke because it is unlikely to be of benefit and may even be harmful.</p>
    <p>In acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema of the upper respiratory tract and anaphylaxis, corticosteroids are indicated as an adjunct to emergency treatment with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref>. In such cases <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydrocortisone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP515\">hydrocortisone</xref> (as sodium succinate) by intravenous injection may be required.</p>
    <p>Corticosteroids are preferably used by inhalation in the management of asthma but systemic therapy in association with bronchodilators is required for the emergency treatment of severe acute asthma.</p>
    <p>Corticosteroids may also be useful in conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis; they may also lead to remissions of acquired haemolytic anaemia, and some cases of the nephrotic syndrome (particularly in children) and thrombocytopenic purpura.</p>
    <p>Corticosteroids can improve the prognosis of serious conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis, and polyarteritis nodosa; the effects of the disease process may be suppressed and symptoms relieved, but the underlying condition is not cured, although it may ultimately remit. It is usual to begin therapy in these conditions at fairly high dose, and then to reduce the dose to the lowest commensurate with disease control.</p>
    <p>For other references to the use of corticosteroids see: Prescribing in Palliative Care, immunosuppression, rheumatic diseases, eye, otitis externa allergic rhinitis, and aphthous ulcers.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Side-effects</p>
    <p>Overdosage or prolonged use can exaggerate some of the normal physiological actions of corticosteroids leading to mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid side-effects.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Mineralocorticoid side effects</p>
      <ul>
        <li>hypertension</li>

        <li>water retention</li>
        <li>potassium loss</li>
        <li>calcium loss</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mineralocorticoid side effects are most marked with fludrocortisone, but are significant with hydrocortisone, corticotropin, and tetracosactide. Mineralocorticoid actions are negligible with the high potency glucocorticoids, betamethasone and dexamethasone, and occur only slightly with methylprednisolone, prednisolone, and triamcinolone.</p>

Dosages of corticosteroids vary widely in different diseases and in different patients. If the use of a corticosteroid can save or prolong life, as in exfoliative dermatitis, pemphigus, acute leukaemia or acute transplant rejection, high doses may need to be given, because the complications of therapy are likely to be less serious than the effects of the disease itself.

When long-term corticosteroid therapy is used in some chronic diseases, the adverse effects of treatment may become greater than the disabilities caused by the disease. To minimise side-effects the maintenance dose should be kept as low as possible.

When potentially less harmful measures are ineffective corticosteroids are used topically for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the skin. Corticosteroids should be avoided or used only under specialist supervision in psoriasis.

Corticosteroids are used both topically (by rectum) and systemically (by mouth or intravenously) in the management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. They are also included in locally applied creams for haemorrhoids.

Use can be made of the mineralocorticoid activity of fludrocortisone acetate to treat postural hypotension in autonomic neuropathy.

High-dose corticosteroids should be avoided for the management of septic shock. However, there is evidence that administration of lower doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone acetate is of benefit in adrenocortical insufficiency resulting from septic shock.

Dexamethasone and betamethasone have little if any mineralocorticoid action and their long duration of action makes them particularly suitable for suppressing corticotropin secretion in congenital adrenal hyperplasia where the dose should be tailored to clinical response and by measurement of adrenal androgens and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In common with all glucocorticoids their suppressive action on the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis is greatest and most prolonged when they are given at night. In most individuals a single dose of dexamethasone at night, is sufficient to inhibit corticotropin secretion for 24 hours. This is the basis of the ‘overnight dexamethasone suppression test’ for diagnosing Cushing’s syndrome.

Betamethasone and dexamethasone are also appropriate for conditions where water retention would be a disadvantage.

A corticosteroid may be used in the management of raised intracranial pressure or cerebral oedema that occurs as a result of malignancy (see Prescribing in palliative care); high doses of betamethasone or dexamethasone are generally used. However, a corticosteroid should not be used for the management of head injury or stroke because it is unlikely to be of benefit and may even be harmful.

In acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema of the upper respiratory tract and anaphylaxis, corticosteroids are indicated as an adjunct to emergency treatment with adrenaline/epinephrine. In such cases hydrocortisone (as sodium succinate) by intravenous injection may be required.

Corticosteroids are preferably used by inhalation in the management of asthma but systemic therapy in association with bronchodilators is required for the emergency treatment of severe acute asthma.

Corticosteroids may also be useful in conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis; they may also lead to remissions of acquired haemolytic anaemia, and some cases of the nephrotic syndrome (particularly in children) and thrombocytopenic purpura.

Corticosteroids can improve the prognosis of serious conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis, and polyarteritis nodosa; the effects of the disease process may be suppressed and symptoms relieved, but the underlying condition is not cured, although it may ultimately remit. It is usual to begin therapy in these conditions at fairly high dose, and then to reduce the dose to the lowest commensurate with disease control.

For other references to the use of corticosteroids see: Prescribing in Palliative Care, immunosuppression, rheumatic diseases, eye, otitis externa allergic rhinitis, and aphthous ulcers.

Side-effects

Overdosage or prolonged use can exaggerate some of the normal physiological actions of corticosteroids leading to mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid side-effects.

Mineralocorticoid side effects

hypertensionsodium retentionwater retentionpotassium losscalcium lossMineralocorticoid side effects are most marked with fludrocortisone, but are significant with hydrocortisone, corticotropin, and tetracosactide. Mineralocorticoid actions are negligible with the high potency glucocorticoids, betamethasone and dexamethasone, and occur only slightly with methylprednisolone, prednisolone, and triamcinolone.

Glucocorticoid side effects

diabetesosteoporosis, which is a danger, particularly in the elderly, as it can result in osteoporotic fractures for example of the hip or vertebrae;in addition high doses are associated with avascular necrosis of the femoral head.Muscle wasting (proximal myopathy) can also occur.Corticosteroid therapy is also weakly linked with peptic ulceration and perforation.Psychiatric reactions may also occur.Managing side-effects

Side-effects can be minimised by using lowest effective dose for minimum period possible. The suppressive action of a corticosteroid on cortisol secretion is least when it is given as a single dose in the morning. In an attempt to reduce pituitary-adrenal suppression further, the total dose for two days can sometimes be taken as a single dose on alternate days; alternate-day administration has not been very successful in the management of asthma. Pituitary-adrenal suppression can also be reduced by means of intermittent therapy with short courses. In some conditions it may be possible to reduce the dose of corticosteroid by adding a small dose of an immunosuppressive drug.

Whenever possible local treatment with creams, intra-articular injections, inhalations, eye-drops, or enemas should be used in preference to systemic treatment.

Inhaled corticosteroids have considerably fewer systemic effects than oral corticosteroids, but adverse effects including adrenal suppression have been reported. Use of other corticosteroid therapy (including topical) or concurrent use of drugs which inhibit corticosteroid metabolism should be taken into account when assessing systemic risk. In children, growth restriction associated with systemic corticosteroid therapy does not seem to occur with recommended doses of inhaled therapy; although initial growth velocity may be reduced, there appears to be no effect on achieving normal adult height. Large-volume spacer devices should be used for administering inhaled corticosteroids in children under 15 years; they are also useful in older children and adults, particularly if high doses are required. Spacer devices increase airway deposition and reduce oropharyngeal deposition.

The adrenal cortex normally secretes hydrocortisone (cortisol) which has glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. It also secretes the mineralocorticoid aldosterone.

In deficiency states, physiological replacement is best achieved with a combination of hydrocortisone and the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone acetate; hydrocortisone alone does not usually provide sufficient mineralocorticoid activity for complete replacement.

In Addison’s disease or following adrenalectomy, hydrocortisone by mouth is usually required. This is given in 2 doses, the larger in the morning and the smaller in the evening, mimicking the normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion. The optimum daily dose is determined on the basis of clinical response. Glucocorticoid therapy is supplemented by fludrocortisone acetate.

In acute adrenocortical insufficiency, hydrocortisone is given intravenously (preferably as sodium succinate) every 6 to 8 hours in sodium chloride intravenous infusion 0.9%.

In hypopituitarism, glucocorticoids should be given as in adrenocortical insufficiency, but since production of aldosterone is also regulated by the renin-angiotensin system a mineralocorticoid is not usually required. Additional replacement therapy with levothyroxine sodium and sex hormones should be given as indicated by the pattern of hormone deficiency.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>The chemotherapy of cancer is complex and should be confined to specialists in oncology. Cytotoxic drugs have both anti-cancer activity and the potential to damage normal tissue; most cytotoxic drugs are teratogenic. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent or it may aim to prolong life or to palliate symptoms. In an increasing number of cases chemotherapy may be combined with radiotherapy or surgery or both as either neoadjuvant treatment (initial chemotherapy aimed at shrinking the primary tumour, thereby rendering local therapy less destructive or more effective) or as adjuvant treatment (which follows definitive treatment of the primary disease, when the risk of subclinical metastatic disease is known to be high). All cytotoxic drugs cause side-effects and a balance has to be struck between likely benefit and acceptable toxicity.</p>
    <p>Combinations of cytotoxic drugs, as continuous or pulsed cycles of treatment, are frequently more toxic than single drugs but have the advantage in certain tumours of enhanced response, reduced development of drug resistance and increased survival. However for some tumours, single-agent chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice.</p>
    <p>Cytotoxic drugs fall into a number of classes, each with characteristic antitumour activity, sites of action, and toxicity. A knowledge of sites of metabolism and excretion is important because impaired drug handling as a result of disease is not uncommon and may result in enhanced toxicity.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trained personnel should reconstitute cytotoxics</li>
      <li>Reconstitution should be carried out in designated pharmacy areas</li>
      <li>Protective clothing (including gloves, gowns, and masks) should be worn</li>
      <li>The eyes should be protected and means of first aid should be specified</li>
      <li>Pregnant staff should avoid exposure to cytotoxic drugs (all females of child-bearing age should be informed of the reproductive hazard)</li>
      <li>Use local procedures for dealing with spillages and safe disposal of waste material, including syringes, containers, and absorbent material</li>
      <li>Staff exposure to cytotoxic drugs should be monitored</li>
    </ul>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Intrathecal chemotherapy</p>
    <p>A Health Service Circular (HSC 2008/001) provides guidance on the introduction of safe practice in NHS Trusts where intrathecal chemotherapy is administered; written local guidance covering all aspects of national guidance should be available.Support for training programmes is also available.</p>

    <p>It is also available from the Department of Health website (<xref format=\"html\" href=\"https://www.dh.gov.uk\">www.dh.gov.uk</xref>).</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Safe systems for cytotoxic medicines</p>
    <p>NHS cancer networks have been established across the UK to bring together all stakeholders in all sectors of care, to work collaboratively to plan and deliver high quality cancer services for a given population. NHS cancer networks have websites containing information on local chemotherapy services and treatment.</p>
    <p>Safe system requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cytotoxic drugs for the treatment of cancer should be given as part of a wider pathway of care coordinated by a multidisciplinary team</li>
      <li>cytotoxic drugs should be prescribed, dispensed, and administered only in the context of a written protocol or treatment plan</li>
      <li>injectable cytotoxic drugs should only be dispensed if they are prepared for administration</li>
      <li>oral cytotoxic medicines should be dispensed with clear directions for use</li>
    </ul>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Important safety information</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of incorrect dosing of oral anti-cancer medicines</p>
      <p>The National Patient Safety Agency has advised (January 2008) that the prescribing and use of oral cytotoxic medicines should be carried out to the same standard as parenteral cytotoxic therapy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>non-specialists who prescribe or administer on-going oral cytotoxic medication should have access to written protocols and treatment plans, including guidance on the monitoring and treatment of toxicity;</li>
        <li>staff dispensing oral cytotoxic medicines should confirm that the prescribed dose is appropriate for the patient. Patients should have written information that includes details of the intended oral anti-cancer regimen, the treatment plan, and arrangements for monitoring, taken from the original protocol from the initiating hospital. Staff dispensing oral cytotoxic medicines should also have access to this information, and to advice from an experienced cancer pharmacist in the initiating hospital.</li>
      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Doses</p>
    <p>Doses of cytotoxic drugs are determined using a variety of different methods including body-surface area or body-weight. Alternatively, doses may be fixed. Doses may be further adjusted following consideration of a patient’s neutrophil count, renal and hepatic function, and history of previous adverse effects to the cytotoxic drug. Doses may also differ depending on whether a drug is used alone or in combination.</p>
    <p>Because of the complexity of dosage regimens in the treatment of malignant disease, dose statements have been omitted from some of the drug entries in this chapter. However, even where dose statements have been provided, detailed specialist literature, individual hospital chemotherapy protocols, or local cancer networks should be consulted before prescribing, dispensing, or administering cytotoxic drugs.</p>
    <p>Prescriptions should <b>not</b> be repeated except on the instructions of a specialist.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Side-effects of cytotoxic drugs</p>
    <p>Side-effects common to most cytotoxic drugs are discussed below whilst side-effects characteristic of a particular drug or class of drugs (e.g. neurotoxicity with vinca alkaloids) are mentioned in the appropriate sections. Manufacturers’ product literature, hospital-trust protocols, and cancer-network protocols should be consulted for full details of side-effects associated with individual drugs and specific chemotherapy regimes.</p>
    <p>Many side-effects of cytotoxic drugs often do not occur at the time of administration, but days or weeks later. It is therefore important that patients and healthcare professionals can identify symptoms that cause concern and can contact an expert for advice. Toxicities should be accurately recorded using a recognised scoring system such as the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed by the National Cancer Institute.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Extravasation of intravenous drugs</p>
      <p>A number of cytotoxic drugs will cause severe local tissue necrosis if leakage into the extravascular compartment occurs. To reduce the risk of extravasation injury it is recommended that cytotoxic drugs are administered by appropriately trained staff. See information on the prevention and management of extravasation injury.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Oral mucositis</p>
      <p>A sore mouth is a common complication of cancer chemotherapy; it is most often associated with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fluorouracil.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5376\">fluorouracil</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methotrexate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP533\">methotrexate</xref>, and the anthracyclines. It is best to prevent the complication. Good oral hygiene (rinsing the mouth frequently and effective brushing of the teeth with a soft brush 2–3 times daily) is probably beneficial. For <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fluorouracil.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5376\">fluorouracil</xref>, sucking ice chips during short infusions of the drug is also helpful.</p>
      <p>Once a sore mouth has developed, treatment is much less effective. Saline mouthwashes should be used but there is no good evidence to support the use of antiseptic or anti-inflammatory mouthwashes. In general, mucositis is self-limiting but with poor oral hygiene it can be a focus for blood-borne infection.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Tumour lysis syndrome</p>
      <p>Tumour lysis syndrome occurs secondary to spontaneous or treatment-related rapid destruction of malignant cells. Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome include those with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (especially if high grade and bulky disease), Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia (particularly if high white blood cell counts or bulky disease), and occasionally those with solid tumours. Pre-existing hyperuricaemia, dehydration, and renal impairment are also predisposing factors. Features include hyperkalaemia, hyperuricaemia (see below), and hyperphosphataemia with hypocalcaemia; renal damage and arrhythmias can follow. Early identification of patients at risk, and initiation of prophylaxis or therapy for tumour lysis syndrome, is essential.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Hyperuricaemia</p>
      <p>Hyperuricaemia, which may be present in high-grade lymphoma and leukaemia, can be markedly worsened by chemotherapy and is associated with acute renal failure. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/allopurinol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6669\">Allopurinol</xref> should be started 24 hours before treating such tumours and patients should be adequately hydrated. The dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mercaptopurine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP531\">mercaptopurine</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/azathioprine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP527\">azathioprine</xref> should be reduced if <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/allopurinol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6669\">allopurinol</xref> needs to be given concomitantly.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rasburicase.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6685\">Rasburicase</xref>, a recombinant urate oxidase, is licensed for hyperuricaemia in patients with haematological malignancy. It rapidly reduces plasma-uric acid concentration and may be of particular value in preventing complications following treatment of leukaemias or bulky lymphomas.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Bone-marrow suppression</p>
      <p>All cytotoxic drugs except <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/vincristine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5415\">vincristine sulfate</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bleomycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5301\">bleomycin</xref> cause bone-marrow suppression. This commonly occurs 7 to 10 days after administration, but is delayed for certain drugs, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/carmustine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5259\">carmustine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/lomustine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5272\">lomustine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/melphalan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5274\">melphalan</xref>. Peripheral blood counts must be checked before each treatment, and doses should be reduced or therapy delayed if bone-marrow has not recovered.</p>
      <p>Cytotoxic drugs may be contra-indicated in patients with acute infection; any infection should be treated before, or when starting, cytotoxic drugs.</p>
      <p>Fever in a neutropenic patient (neutrophil count less than 1.06×10<sup>9</sup>/litre) requires immediate broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Appropriate bacteriological investigations should be conducted as soon as possible. Patients taking cytotoxic drugs who have signs or symptoms of infection should be advised to seek prompt medical attention. All patients should initially be investigated and treated under the supervision of the appropriate oncology or haematology specialist.</p>
      <p>In selected patients, the duration and the severity of neutropenia can be reduced by the use of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factors.</p>
      <p>Symptomatic anaemia is usually treated with red blood cell transfusions. For guidance on the use of erythropoietins in patients with cancer, see MHRA/CHM advice and NICE guidance.</p>
      <p>See advice on the use of live vaccines in individuals with impaired immune response, see Vaccines.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Alopecia</p>
      <p>Reversible hair loss is a common complication, although it varies in degree between drugs and individual patients. No pharmacological methods of preventing this are available.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Thromboembolism</p>
      <p>Venous thromboembolism can be a complication of cancer itself, but chemotherapy increases the risk.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Pregnancy and reproductive function</p>
    <p>Most cytotoxic drugs are teratogenic and should not be administered during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Considerable caution is necessary if a pregnant woman presents with cancer requiring chemotherapy, and specialist advice should always be sought.</p>
    <p>Exclude pregnancy before treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Contraceptive advice should be given before cytotoxic therapy begins- women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment.</p>
    <p>Regimens that do not contain an alkylating drug or procarbazine may have less effect on fertility, but those with an alkylating drug or procarbazine carry the risk of causing permanent male sterility (there is no effect on potency). Pretreatment counselling and consideration of sperm storage may be appropriate. Women are less severely affected, though the span of reproductive life may be shortened by the onset of a premature menopause. No increase in fetal abnormalities or abortion rate has been recorded in patients who remain fertile after cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Nausea and vomiting</p>
    <p>Nausea and vomiting cause considerable distress to many patients who receive chemotherapy and to a lesser extent abdominal radiotherapy, and may lead to refusal of further treatment; prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting is therefore extremely important. Symptoms may be acute (occurring within 24 hours of treatment), delayed (first occurring more than 24 hours after treatment), or anticipatory (occurring prior to subsequent doses). Delayed and anticipatory symptoms are more difficult to control than acute symptoms and require different management.</p>
    <p>Patients vary in their susceptibility to drug-induced nausea and vomiting; those affected more often include women, patients under 50 years of age, anxious patients, and those who experience motion sickness. Susceptibility also increases with repeated exposure to the cytotoxic drug.</p>
    <p>Drugs may be divided according to their emetogenic potential and some examples are given below, but the symptoms vary according to the dose, to other drugs administered and to the individual's susceptibility to emetogenic stimuli.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Mildly emetogenic treatment</i>—<xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fluorouracil.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5376\">fluorouracil</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/etoposide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5408\">etoposide</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methotrexate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP533\">methotrexate</xref> (less than 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, low dose in children), the vinca alkaloids, and abdominal radiotherapy.</p>

    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Prevention of delayed symptoms</p>
      <p>For delayed symptoms associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, a combination of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">dexamethasone</xref> and 5HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist is effective; for highly emetogenic chemotherapy, a combination of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dexamethasone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4364\">dexamethasone</xref> and aprepitant is effective. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metoclopramide-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2547\">Metoclopramide hydrochloride</xref> is also licensed for delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.</p>

The chemotherapy of cancer is complex and should be confined to specialists in oncology. Cytotoxic drugs have both anti-cancer activity and the potential to damage normal tissue; most cytotoxic drugs are teratogenic. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent or it may aim to prolong life or to palliate symptoms. In an increasing number of cases chemotherapy may be combined with radiotherapy or surgery or both as either neoadjuvant treatment (initial chemotherapy aimed at shrinking the primary tumour, thereby rendering local therapy less destructive or more effective) or as adjuvant treatment (which follows definitive treatment of the primary disease, when the risk of subclinical metastatic disease is known to be high). All cytotoxic drugs cause side-effects and a balance has to be struck between likely benefit and acceptable toxicity.

Combinations of cytotoxic drugs, as continuous or pulsed cycles of treatment, are frequently more toxic than single drugs but have the advantage in certain tumours of enhanced response, reduced development of drug resistance and increased survival. However for some tumours, single-agent chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice.

Cytotoxic drugs fall into a number of classes, each with characteristic antitumour activity, sites of action, and toxicity. A knowledge of sites of metabolism and excretion is important because impaired drug handling as a result of disease is not uncommon and may result in enhanced toxicity.

Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs

Trained personnel should reconstitute cytotoxicsReconstitution should be carried out in designated pharmacy areasProtective clothing (including gloves, gowns, and masks) should be wornThe eyes should be protected and means of first aid should be specifiedPregnant staff should avoid exposure to cytotoxic drugs (all females of child-bearing age should be informed of the reproductive hazard)Use local procedures for dealing with spillages and safe disposal of waste material, including syringes, containers, and absorbent materialStaff exposure to cytotoxic drugs should be monitoredIntrathecal chemotherapy

A Health Service Circular (HSC 2008/001) provides guidance on the introduction of safe practice in NHS Trusts where intrathecal chemotherapy is administered; written local guidance covering all aspects of national guidance should be available.Support for training programmes is also available.

Safe systems for cytotoxic medicines

NHS cancer networks have been established across the UK to bring together all stakeholders in all sectors of care, to work collaboratively to plan and deliver high quality cancer services for a given population. NHS cancer networks have websites containing information on local chemotherapy services and treatment.

Safe system requirements:

cytotoxic drugs for the treatment of cancer should be given as part of a wider pathway of care coordinated by a multidisciplinary teamcytotoxic drugs should be prescribed, dispensed, and administered only in the context of a written protocol or treatment planinjectable cytotoxic drugs should only be dispensed if they are prepared for administrationoral cytotoxic medicines should be dispensed with clear directions for useImportant safety information

Risk of incorrect dosing of oral anti-cancer medicines

The National Patient Safety Agency has advised (January 2008) that the prescribing and use of oral cytotoxic medicines should be carried out to the same standard as parenteral cytotoxic therapy.

non-specialists who prescribe or administer on-going oral cytotoxic medication should have access to written protocols and treatment plans, including guidance on the monitoring and treatment of toxicity;staff dispensing oral cytotoxic medicines should confirm that the prescribed dose is appropriate for the patient. Patients should have written information that includes details of the intended oral anti-cancer regimen, the treatment plan, and arrangements for monitoring, taken from the original protocol from the initiating hospital. Staff dispensing oral cytotoxic medicines should also have access to this information, and to advice from an experienced cancer pharmacist in the initiating hospital.Doses

Doses of cytotoxic drugs are determined using a variety of different methods including body-surface area or body-weight. Alternatively, doses may be fixed. Doses may be further adjusted following consideration of a patient’s neutrophil count, renal and hepatic function, and history of previous adverse effects to the cytotoxic drug. Doses may also differ depending on whether a drug is used alone or in combination.

Because of the complexity of dosage regimens in the treatment of malignant disease, dose statements have been omitted from some of the drug entries in this chapter. However, even where dose statements have been provided, detailed specialist literature, individual hospital chemotherapy protocols, or local cancer networks should be consulted before prescribing, dispensing, or administering cytotoxic drugs.

Prescriptions should not be repeated except on the instructions of a specialist.

Side-effects of cytotoxic drugs

Side-effects common to most cytotoxic drugs are discussed below whilst side-effects characteristic of a particular drug or class of drugs (e.g. neurotoxicity with vinca alkaloids) are mentioned in the appropriate sections. Manufacturers’ product literature, hospital-trust protocols, and cancer-network protocols should be consulted for full details of side-effects associated with individual drugs and specific chemotherapy regimes.

Many side-effects of cytotoxic drugs often do not occur at the time of administration, but days or weeks later. It is therefore important that patients and healthcare professionals can identify symptoms that cause concern and can contact an expert for advice. Toxicities should be accurately recorded using a recognised scoring system such as the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed by the National Cancer Institute.

Extravasation of intravenous drugs

A number of cytotoxic drugs will cause severe local tissue necrosis if leakage into the extravascular compartment occurs. To reduce the risk of extravasation injury it is recommended that cytotoxic drugs are administered by appropriately trained staff. See information on the prevention and management of extravasation injury.

Oral mucositis

A sore mouth is a common complication of cancer chemotherapy; it is most often associated with fluorouracil, methotrexate, and the anthracyclines. It is best to prevent the complication. Good oral hygiene (rinsing the mouth frequently and effective brushing of the teeth with a soft brush 2–3 times daily) is probably beneficial. For fluorouracil, sucking ice chips during short infusions of the drug is also helpful.

Once a sore mouth has developed, treatment is much less effective. Saline mouthwashes should be used but there is no good evidence to support the use of antiseptic or anti-inflammatory mouthwashes. In general, mucositis is self-limiting but with poor oral hygiene it can be a focus for blood-borne infection.

Tumour lysis syndrome

Tumour lysis syndrome occurs secondary to spontaneous or treatment-related rapid destruction of malignant cells. Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome include those with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (especially if high grade and bulky disease), Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia (particularly if high white blood cell counts or bulky disease), and occasionally those with solid tumours. Pre-existing hyperuricaemia, dehydration, and renal impairment are also predisposing factors. Features include hyperkalaemia, hyperuricaemia (see below), and hyperphosphataemia with hypocalcaemia; renal damage and arrhythmias can follow. Early identification of patients at risk, and initiation of prophylaxis or therapy for tumour lysis syndrome, is essential.

Hyperuricaemia

Hyperuricaemia, which may be present in high-grade lymphoma and leukaemia, can be markedly worsened by chemotherapy and is associated with acute renal failure. Allopurinol should be started 24 hours before treating such tumours and patients should be adequately hydrated. The dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be reduced if allopurinol needs to be given concomitantly.

Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, is licensed for hyperuricaemia in patients with haematological malignancy. It rapidly reduces plasma-uric acid concentration and may be of particular value in preventing complications following treatment of leukaemias or bulky lymphomas.

Bone-marrow suppression

All cytotoxic drugs except vincristine sulfate and bleomycin cause bone-marrow suppression. This commonly occurs 7 to 10 days after administration, but is delayed for certain drugs, such as carmustine, lomustine, and melphalan. Peripheral blood counts must be checked before each treatment, and doses should be reduced or therapy delayed if bone-marrow has not recovered.

Cytotoxic drugs may be contra-indicated in patients with acute infection; any infection should be treated before, or when starting, cytotoxic drugs.

Fever in a neutropenic patient (neutrophil count less than 1.06×109/litre) requires immediate broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Appropriate bacteriological investigations should be conducted as soon as possible. Patients taking cytotoxic drugs who have signs or symptoms of infection should be advised to seek prompt medical attention. All patients should initially be investigated and treated under the supervision of the appropriate oncology or haematology specialist.

In selected patients, the duration and the severity of neutropenia can be reduced by the use of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factors.

Symptomatic anaemia is usually treated with red blood cell transfusions. For guidance on the use of erythropoietins in patients with cancer, see MHRA/CHM advice and NICE guidance.

See advice on the use of live vaccines in individuals with impaired immune response, see Vaccines.

Alopecia

Reversible hair loss is a common complication, although it varies in degree between drugs and individual patients. No pharmacological methods of preventing this are available.

Thromboembolism

Venous thromboembolism can be a complication of cancer itself, but chemotherapy increases the risk.

Pregnancy and reproductive function

Most cytotoxic drugs are teratogenic and should not be administered during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Considerable caution is necessary if a pregnant woman presents with cancer requiring chemotherapy, and specialist advice should always be sought.

Exclude pregnancy before treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Contraceptive advice should be given before cytotoxic therapy begins- women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment.

Regimens that do not contain an alkylating drug or procarbazine may have less effect on fertility, but those with an alkylating drug or procarbazine carry the risk of causing permanent male sterility (there is no effect on potency). Pretreatment counselling and consideration of sperm storage may be appropriate. Women are less severely affected, though the span of reproductive life may be shortened by the onset of a premature menopause. No increase in fetal abnormalities or abortion rate has been recorded in patients who remain fertile after cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Nausea and vomiting

Nausea and vomiting cause considerable distress to many patients who receive chemotherapy and to a lesser extent abdominal radiotherapy, and may lead to refusal of further treatment; prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting is therefore extremely important. Symptoms may be acute (occurring within 24 hours of treatment), delayed (first occurring more than 24 hours after treatment), or anticipatory (occurring prior to subsequent doses). Delayed and anticipatory symptoms are more difficult to control than acute symptoms and require different management.

Patients vary in their susceptibility to drug-induced nausea and vomiting; those affected more often include women, patients under 50 years of age, anxious patients, and those who experience motion sickness. Susceptibility also increases with repeated exposure to the cytotoxic drug.

Drugs may be divided according to their emetogenic potential and some examples are given below, but the symptoms vary according to the dose, to other drugs administered and to the individual's susceptibility to emetogenic stimuli.

Mildly emetogenic treatment—fluorouracil, etoposide, methotrexate (less than 100 mg/m2, low dose in children), the vinca alkaloids, and abdominal radiotherapy.

Moderately emetogenic treatment—the taxanes, doxorubicin hydrochloride, intermediate and low doses of cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and high doses of methotrexate (0.1– 1.2 g/m2).

Highly emetogenic treatment—cisplatin, dacarbazine, and high doses of cyclophosphamide.

Prevention of acute symptoms

For patients at low risk of emesis, pretreatment with dexamethasone or lorazepam may be used.

For patients at high risk of emesis, a 5HT3-receptor antagonist, usually given by mouth in combination with dexamethasone and the neurokinin receptor antagonist aprepitant is effective.

Prevention of delayed symptoms

For delayed symptoms associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, a combination of dexamethasone and 5HT3-receptor antagonist is effective; for highly emetogenic chemotherapy, a combination of dexamethasone and aprepitant is effective. Metoclopramide hydrochloride is also licensed for delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

Prevention of anticipatory symptoms

Good symptom control is the best way to prevent anticipatory symptoms. Lorazepam can be helpful for its amnesic, sedative, and anxiolytic effects.

Treatment for cytotoxic-induced side effects

Anthracycline side-effects

Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity

The anthracycline cytotoxic drugs are associated with dose-related, cumulative, and potentially life-threatening cardiotoxic side-effects.

Anthracycline extravasation

Local guidelines for the management of extravasation should be followed or specialist advice sought.

See further information on the prevention and management of extravasation injury.

Chemotherapy-induced mucositis and myelosuppression

Folinic acid (given as calcium folinate) is used to counteract the folate-antagonist action of methotrexate and thus speed recovery from methotrexate-induced mucositis or myelosuppression (‘folinic acid rescue’).

Folinic acid is also used in the management of methotrexate overdose, together with other measures to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, and to manage possible renal failure.

Folinic acid does not counteract the antibacterial activity of folate antagonists such as trimethoprim.

When folinic acid and fluorouracil are used together in metastatic colorectal cancer the response-rate improves compared to that with fluorouracil alone.

The calcium salt of levofolinic acid, a single isomer of folinic acid, is also used for rescue therapy following methotrexate administration, for cases of methotrexate overdose, and for use with fluorouracil for colorectal cancer. The dose of calcium levofolinate is generally half that of calcium folinate.

The disodium salts of folinic acid and levofolinic acid are also used for rescue therapy following methotrexate therapy, and for use with fluorouracil for colorectal cancer.

Urothelial toxicity

Haemorrhagic cystitis is a common manifestation of urothelial toxicity which occurs with the oxazaphosphorines, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide; it is caused by the metabolite acrolein. Mesna reacts specifically with this metabolite in the urinary tract, preventing toxicity. Mesna is used routinely (preferably by mouth) in patients receiving ifosfamide, and in patients receiving cyclophosphamide by the intravenous route at a high dose (e.g. more than 2 g) or in those who experienced urothelial toxicity when given cyclophosphamide previously.

Anthracyclines and other cytotoxic antibiotics

Drugs in this group are widely used. Many cytotoxic antibiotics act as radiomimetics and simultaneous use of radiotherapy should be avoided because it may markedly increased toxicity. Daunorubicin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, epirubicin hydrochloride and idarubicin hydrochloride are anthracycline antibiotics. Mitoxantrone is an anthracycline derivative.

Doxorubicin hydrochloride is available as both conventional and liposomal formulations. The different formulations vary in their licensed indications, pharmacokinetics, dosage and administration, and are not interchangeable. Conventional doxorubicin hydrochloride is used to treat the acute leukaemias, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, paediatric malignancies, and some solid tumours including breast cancer.

Epirubicin hydrochloride is structurally related to doxorubicin hydrochloride and clinical trials suggest that it is as effective in the treatment of breast cancer.

Idarubicin hydrochloride has general properties similar to those of doxorubicin hydrochloride; it is mostly used in the treatment of haematological malignancies.

Daunorubicin also has general properties similar to those of doxorubicin hydrochloride.

Mitoxantrone is structurally related to doxorubicin hydrochloride.

Pixantrone is licensed as monotherapy for the treatment of refractory or multiply relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas, although the benefits of using it as a fifth-line or greater chemotherapy in refractory patients has not been established.

Bleomycin is given intravenously or intramuscularly to treat metastatic germ cell cancer and, in some regimens, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Dactinomycin is principally used to treat paediatric cancers. Its side-effects are similar to those of doxorubicin, except that cardiac toxicity is not a problem.

Mitomycin is given intravenously to treat upper gastrointestinal and breast cancers and by bladder instillation for superficial bladder tumours. It causes delayed bone marrow toxicity and therefore it is usually administered at 6-weekly intervals.

Vinca alkaloids

The vinca alkaloids, vinblastine sulfate, vincristine sulfate, and vindesine sulfate, are used to treat a variety of cancers including leukaemias, lymphomas, and some solid tumours (e.g. breast and lung cancer). Vinorelbine is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid. See also, role of vinorelbine in the treatment of breast cancer.

Antimetabolites

Antimetabolites are incorporated into new nuclear material or combine irreversibly with cellular enzymes, preventing normal cellular division.

Alkylating drugs

Extensive experience is available with these drugs, which are among the most widely used in cancer chemotherapy. They act by damaging DNA, thus interfering with cell replication.

Cyclophosphamide is used mainly in combination with other agents for treating a wide range of malignancies, including some leukaemias, lymphomas, and solid tumours. It is given by mouth or intravenously; it is inactive until metabolised by the liver.

Ifosfamide is related to cyclophosphamide and is given intravenously.

Melphalan is licensed for the treatment of multiple myeloma, polycythaemia vera, childhood neuroblastoma, advanced ovarian adenocarcinoma, and advanced breast cancer. However, in practice, melphalan is rarely used for ovarian adenocarcinoma; it is no longer used for advanced breast cancer. Melphalan is also licensed for regional arterial perfusion in localised malignant melanoma of the extremities and localised soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremities.

Lomustine is a lipid-soluble nitrosourea and the drug is given at intervals of 4 to 6 weeks.

Carmustine has similar activity to lomustine; it is given to patients with multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and brain tumours. Carmustine implants are licensed for intralesional use in adults for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme as an adjunct to surgery. Carmustine implants are also licensed for high-grade malignant glioma as adjunctive treatment to surgery and radiotherapy.

Estramustine phosphate is a combination of an oestrogen and chlormethine used predominantly in prostate cancer. It is given by mouth and has both an antimitotic effect and (by reducing testosterone concentration) a hormonal effect.

Mitobronitol is occasionally used to treat chronic myeloid leukaemia; it is available on a named-patient basis from specialist importing companies.

Oral glucose tolerance test

The oral glucose tolerance test is used mainly for diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance; it is not recommended or necessary for routine diagnostic use when severe symptoms of hyperglycaemia are present. In patients who have less severe symptoms and blood glucose levels that do not establish or exclude diabetes (e.g. impaired fasting glycaemia), an oral glucose tolerance test may be required. It is also used to establish the presence of gestational diabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test generally involves giving anhydrous glucose by mouth to the fasting patient, and measuring blood-glucose concentrations at intervals.

The appropriate amount of glucose should be given with 200–300 mL fluid. Anhydrous glucose may alternatively be given as 113 mL Polycal with extra fluid to administer a total volume of 200–300 mL, or as RapiloseOGTT oral solution.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Diabetes mellitus occurs because of a lack of insulin or resistance to its action. It is diagnosed by measuring fasting or random blood-glucose concentration (and occasionally by oral glucose tolerance test). Although there are many subtypes, the two principal classes of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Type 1 diabetes</i>, (formerly referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)), occurs as a result of a deficiency of insulin following autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Patients with type 1 diabetes require administration of insulin.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Type 2 diabetes</i>, (formerly referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM)), is due to reduced secretion of insulin or to peripheral resistance to the action of insulin or to a combination of both. Although patients may be controlled on diet alone, many also require oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin (or both) to maintain satisfactory control. In overweight individuals, type 2 diabetes may be prevented by losing weight and increasing physical activity; use of the anti-obesity drug <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/orlistat.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2496\">orlistat</xref> may be considered in obese patients.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Treatment of diabetes</p>
    <p>Treatment of all forms of diabetes should be aimed at alleviating symptoms and minimising the risk of long-term complications; tight control of diabetes is essential.</p>
    <p>Diabetes is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidaemia should be addressed. Cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes can be further reduced by the use of an ACE inhibitor, low-dose <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> and a lipid-regulating drug.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Prevention of diabetic complications</p>
    <p>Optimal glycaemic control in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes reduces, in the long term, the risk of microvascular complications including retinopathy, development of proteinuria and to some extent neuropathy. However, a temporary deterioration in established diabetic retinopathy may occur when normalising blood-glucose concentration. (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists may also have a role in the management of diabetic nephropathy).</p>
    <p>A measure of the total glycosylated (or glycated) haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1</sub>) or a specific fraction (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) provides a good indication of glycaemic control over the previous 2–3 months. Overall it is ideal to aim for an HbA<sub>1c</sub> (glycosylated haemoglobin) concentration of 48–59 mmol/mol or less (reference range 20–42 mmol/mol) but this cannot always be achieved and for those using insulin there is a significantly increased risk of disabling hypoglycaemia; in those at risk of arterial disease, the aim should be to maintain the HbA<sub>1c</sub> concentration at 48 mmol/mol or less. HbA<sub>1c</sub> should be measured every 3–6 months.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Driving</p>
    <p>Drivers with diabetes may be required to notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) of their condition depending on their treatment, the type of licence, and whether they have diabetic complications. Detailed guidance on eligibility to drive, and precautions required, is available from the DVLA (<xref format=\"html\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/at-a-glance\">www.gov.uk/government/publications/at-a-glance</xref>).</p>
    <p>Drivers need to be particularly careful to avoid hypoglycaemia and should be warned of the problems. Drivers treated with insulin should normally check their blood-glucose concentration before driving and, on long journeys, at 2-hour intervals as specified by DVLA guidance; depending on the type of licence, monitoring may also be necessary for drivers taking oral antidiabetic drugs which carry a risk of hypoglycaemia (e.g. sulfonylureas, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nateglinide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4192\">nateglinide</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/repaglinide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4201\">repaglinide</xref>). Drivers treated with insulin should ensure that a supply of sugar is always available in the vehicle and they should avoid driving if their meal is delayed. If hypoglycaemia occurs, or warning signs develop, the driver should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>stop the vehicle in a safe place;</li>
      <li>switch off the ignition and move from the driver’s seat;</li>
      <li>eat or drink a suitable source of sugar;</li>
      <li>wait until 45 minutes after blood glucose has returned to normal, before continuing journey.</li>
    </ul>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Diabetic nephropathy</p>
    <p>Regular review of diabetic patients should include an annual test for urinary protein (using <i>Albustix</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) and serum creatinine measurement. If the urinary protein test is negative, the urine should be test for microalbuminuria (the earliest sign of nephropathy). If reagent strip tests (<i>Micral-Test II</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> or <i>Microbumintest </i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) are used and prove positive, the result should be confirmed by laboratory analysis of a urine sample. Provided there are no contra-indications, all diabetic patients with nephropathy causing proteinurea or with established microalbuminuria (at least 3 positive tests) should be treated with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist even if the blood pressure is normal; in any case, to minimise the risk of renal deterioration, blood pressure should be carefully controlled. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are particularly susceptible to developing hyperkalaemia and should not be given an ACE inhibitor together with an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist.</p>
    <p>ACE inhibitors can potentiate the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs; this effect is more likely during the first weeks of combined treatment and in patients with renal impairment.</p>

Diabetes mellitus occurs because of a lack of insulin or resistance to its action. It is diagnosed by measuring fasting or random blood-glucose concentration (and occasionally by oral glucose tolerance test). Although there are many subtypes, the two principal classes of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes, (formerly referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)), occurs as a result of a deficiency of insulin following autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Patients with type 1 diabetes require administration of insulin.

Although patients may be controlled on diet alone, many also require oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin (or both) to maintain satisfactory control. In overweight individuals, type 2 diabetes may be prevented by losing weight and increasing physical activity; use of the anti-obesity drug orlistat may be considered in obese patients.

Treatment of diabetes

Treatment of all forms of diabetes should be aimed at alleviating symptoms and minimising the risk of long-term complications; tight control of diabetes is essential.

Diabetes is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidaemia should be addressed. Cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes can be further reduced by the use of an ACE inhibitor, low-dose aspirin and a lipid-regulating drug.

Prevention of diabetic complications

Optimal glycaemic control in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes reduces, in the long term, the risk of microvascular complications including retinopathy, development of proteinuria and to some extent neuropathy. However, a temporary deterioration in established diabetic retinopathy may occur when normalising blood-glucose concentration. (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists may also have a role in the management of diabetic nephropathy).

A measure of the total glycosylated (or glycated) haemoglobin (HbA1) or a specific fraction (HbA1c) provides a good indication of glycaemic control over the previous 2–3 months. Overall it is ideal to aim for an HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) concentration of 48–59 mmol/mol or less (reference range 20–42 mmol/mol) but this cannot always be achieved and for those using insulin there is a significantly increased risk of disabling hypoglycaemia; in those at risk of arterial disease, the aim should be to maintain the HbA1c concentration at 48 mmol/mol or less. HbA1c should be measured every 3–6 months.

Measurement of HbA1c

HbA1c values are expressed in mmol of glycosylated haemoglobin per mol of haemoglobin (mmol/mol), a standardised unit specific for HbA1c created by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC). HbA1c values were previously aligned to the assay used in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and expressed as a percentage.

Equivalent valuesIFCC-HbA1c (mmol/mol)DCCT-HbA1c (%)426.0486.5537.0597.5648.0759.0Laboratory measurement of serum-fructosamine concentration is technically simpler and cheaper than the measurement of HbA1c and can be used to assess control over short periods of time, particularly when HbA1c monitoring is invalid (e.g. disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type).

Tight control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes reduces mortality and protects visual acuity (by reducing considerably the risks of maculopathy and retinal photocoagulation).

Driving

Drivers with diabetes may be required to notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) of their condition depending on their treatment, the type of licence, and whether they have diabetic complications. Detailed guidance on eligibility to drive, and precautions required, is available from the DVLA (www.gov.uk/government/publications/at-a-glance).

Drivers need to be particularly careful to avoid hypoglycaemia and should be warned of the problems. Drivers treated with insulin should normally check their blood-glucose concentration before driving and, on long journeys, at 2-hour intervals as specified by DVLA guidance; depending on the type of licence, monitoring may also be necessary for drivers taking oral antidiabetic drugs which carry a risk of hypoglycaemia (e.g. sulfonylureas, nateglinide, repaglinide). Drivers treated with insulin should ensure that a supply of sugar is always available in the vehicle and they should avoid driving if their meal is delayed. If hypoglycaemia occurs, or warning signs develop, the driver should:

stop the vehicle in a safe place;switch off the ignition and move from the driver’s seat;eat or drink a suitable source of sugar;wait until 45 minutes after blood glucose has returned to normal, before continuing journey.Diabetic nephropathy

Diabetic neuropathy

Optimal diabetic control is beneficial for the management of painful neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen may relieve mild to moderate pain.

Duloxetine is effective for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy; amitriptyline hydrochloride [unlicensed use] can be used if duloxetine is ineffective or unsuitable. Nortriptyline [unlicensed use] may be better tolerated than amitriptyline hydrochloride. If treatment with amitriptyline hydrochloride or duloxetine is inadequate, treatment withpregabalin should be tried. Combination therapy of duloxetine or amitriptyline hydrochloride with pregabalin can be used if monotherapy at the maximum tolerated dose does not control symptoms.

Neuropathic pain may respond to opioid analgesics. There is evidence of efficacy for tramadol hydrochloride, morphine, and oxycodone hydrochloride; however treatment with morphine or oxycodone hydrochloride should be initiated only under specialist supervision. Tramadol hydrochloride can be prescribed while the patient is waiting for assessment by a specialist if other treatments have been unsuccessful.

Gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Capsaicin cream 0.075% is licensed for painful diabetic neuropathy and may have some effect, but it produces an intense burning sensation during the initial treatment period.

In autonomic neuropathy diabetic diarrhoea can often be managed by tetracyline [unlicensed use], otherwise codeine phosphate is the best drug, but other antidiarrhoeal preparations can be tried. Erythromycin (especial when given intravenously) may be beneficial for gastroparesis [unlicensed use] but this needs confirmation.

In neuropathic postural hypotension increased salt intake and the use of the mineralcorticoid fludrocortisone acetate [unlicensed use] may help by increasing plasma volume, but uncomfortable oedema is a common side-effect. Fludrocortisone can also be combined with flurbiprofen and ephedrine hydrochloride [both unlicensed]. Midodrine [unlicensed], an alpha agonist, may also be useful in postural hypotension.

Gustatory sweating can be treated with an antimuscarinic such as propantheline bromide; side-effects are common. See the management of hyperhidrosis (Antiperspirants).

In some patients with neuropathic oedema, ephedrine hydrochloride [unlicensed use] offers effective relief.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>
      <b>Thiazides</b> are used to relieve oedema due to chronic heart failure and, in lower doses, to reduce blood pressure.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Loop diuretics</b> are used in pulmonary oedema due to left ventricular failure and in patients with chronic heart failure.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Combination diuretic therapy</b> may be effective in patients with oedema resistant to treatment with one diuretic. Vigorous diuresis, particularly with loop diuretics, may induce acute hypotension; rapid reduction of plasma volume should be avoided.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Thiazides and related diuretics</p>
    <p>Thiazides and related compounds are moderately potent diuretics; they inhibit sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted tubule. They act within 1 to 2 hours of oral administration and most have a duration of action of 12 to 24 hours; they are usually administered early in the day so that the diuresis does not interfere with sleep.</p>
    <p>In the management of <i>hypertension</i> a low dose of a thiazide produces a maximal or near-maximal blood pressure lowering effect, with very little biochemical disturbance. Higher doses cause more marked changes in plasma potassium, sodium, uric acid, glucose, and lipids, with little advantage in blood pressure control. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlortalidone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP785\">Chlortalidone</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/indapamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP792\">indapamide</xref> are the preferred diuretics in the management of hypertension. Thiazides also have a role in chronic heart failure.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bendroflumethiazide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP780\">Bendroflumethiazide</xref> can be used for mild or moderate heart failure; it is licensed for the treatment of hypertension but is no longer considered the first-line diuretic for this indication, although patients with stable and controlled blood pressure currently taking <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bendroflumethiazide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP780\">bendroflumethiazide</xref> can continue treatment.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlortalidone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP785\">Chlortalidone</xref>, a thiazide-related compound, has a longer duration of action than the thiazides and may be given on alternate days to control oedema. It is also useful if acute retention is liable to be precipitated by a more rapid diuresis or if patients dislike the altered pattern of micturition caused by other diuretics. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlortalidone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP785\">Chlortalidone</xref> can also be used under close supervision for the treatment of ascites due to cirrhosis in stable patients.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/xipamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP803\">Xipamide</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/indapamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP792\">indapamide</xref>are chemically related to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlortalidone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP785\">chlortalidone</xref>. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/indapamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP792\">Indapamide</xref> is claimed to lower blood pressure with less metabolic disturbance, particularly less aggravation of diabetes mellitus.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metolazone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP799\">Metolazone</xref> is particularly effective when combined with a loop diuretic (even in renal failure); profound diuresis can occur and the patient should therefore be monitored carefully.</p>
    <p>The thiazide diuretics benzthiazide, clopamide, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cyclopenthiazide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP788\">cyclopenthiazide</xref>, hydrochlorothiazide, and hydroflumethiazide do not offer any significant advantage over other thiazides and related diuretics.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Loop diuretics</p>
    <p>Loop diuretics are used in pulmonary oedema due to left ventricular failure; intravenous administration produces relief of breathlessness and reduces pre-load sooner than would be expected from the time of onset of diuresis. Loop diuretics are also used in patients with chronic heart failure. Diuretic-resistant oedema (except lymphoedema and oedema due to peripheral venous stasis or calcium-channel blockers) can be treated with a loop diuretic combined with a thiazide or related diuretic (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bendroflumethiazide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP780\">bendroflumethiazide</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metolazone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP799\">metolazone</xref>).</p>
    <p>If necessary, a loop diuretic can be added to antihypertensive treatment to achieve better control of blood pressure in those with resistant hypertension, or in patients with impaired renal function or heart failure.</p>
    <p>Loop diuretics can exacerbate diabetes (but hyperglycaemia is less likely than with thiazides) and gout. If there is an enlarged prostate, urinary retention can occur, although this is less likely if small doses and less potent diuretics are used initially.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/furosemide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP815\">Furosemide</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bumetanide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP812\">bumetanide</xref> are similar in activity; both act within 1 hour of oral administration and diuresis is complete within 6 hours so that, if necessary, they can be given twice in one day without interfering with sleep. Following intravenous administration <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/furosemide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP815\">furosemide</xref> has a peak effect within 30 minutes. The diuresis associated with these drugs is dose related.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/torasemide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP818\">Torasemide</xref> has properties similar to those of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/furosemide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP815\">furosemide</xref>and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bumetanide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP812\">bumetanide</xref>, and is indicated for oedema and for hypertension.</p>

Thiazides are used to relieve oedema due to chronic heart failure and, in lower doses, to reduce blood pressure.

Loop diuretics are used in pulmonary oedema due to left ventricular failure and in patients with chronic heart failure.

Combination diuretic therapy may be effective in patients with oedema resistant to treatment with one diuretic. Vigorous diuresis, particularly with loop diuretics, may induce acute hypotension; rapid reduction of plasma volume should be avoided.

Thiazides and related diuretics

Thiazides and related compounds are moderately potent diuretics; they inhibit sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted tubule. They act within 1 to 2 hours of oral administration and most have a duration of action of 12 to 24 hours; they are usually administered early in the day so that the diuresis does not interfere with sleep.

In the management of hypertension a low dose of a thiazide produces a maximal or near-maximal blood pressure lowering effect, with very little biochemical disturbance. Higher doses cause more marked changes in plasma potassium, sodium, uric acid, glucose, and lipids, with little advantage in blood pressure control. Chlortalidone and indapamide are the preferred diuretics in the management of hypertension. Thiazides also have a role in chronic heart failure.

Bendroflumethiazide can be used for mild or moderate heart failure; it is licensed for the treatment of hypertension but is no longer considered the first-line diuretic for this indication, although patients with stable and controlled blood pressure currently taking bendroflumethiazide can continue treatment.

Chlortalidone, a thiazide-related compound, has a longer duration of action than the thiazides and may be given on alternate days to control oedema. It is also useful if acute retention is liable to be precipitated by a more rapid diuresis or if patients dislike the altered pattern of micturition caused by other diuretics. Chlortalidone can also be used under close supervision for the treatment of ascites due to cirrhosis in stable patients.

Xipamide and indapamideare chemically related to chlortalidone. Indapamide is claimed to lower blood pressure with less metabolic disturbance, particularly less aggravation of diabetes mellitus.

Metolazone is particularly effective when combined with a loop diuretic (even in renal failure); profound diuresis can occur and the patient should therefore be monitored carefully.

The thiazide diuretics benzthiazide, clopamide, cyclopenthiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, and hydroflumethiazide do not offer any significant advantage over other thiazides and related diuretics.

Loop diuretics

Loop diuretics are used in pulmonary oedema due to left ventricular failure; intravenous administration produces relief of breathlessness and reduces pre-load sooner than would be expected from the time of onset of diuresis. Loop diuretics are also used in patients with chronic heart failure. Diuretic-resistant oedema (except lymphoedema and oedema due to peripheral venous stasis or calcium-channel blockers) can be treated with a loop diuretic combined with a thiazide or related diuretic (e.g. bendroflumethiazide or metolazone).

If necessary, a loop diuretic can be added to antihypertensive treatment to achieve better control of blood pressure in those with resistant hypertension, or in patients with impaired renal function or heart failure.

Loop diuretics can exacerbate diabetes (but hyperglycaemia is less likely than with thiazides) and gout. If there is an enlarged prostate, urinary retention can occur, although this is less likely if small doses and less potent diuretics are used initially.

Furosemide and bumetanide are similar in activity; both act within 1 hour of oral administration and diuresis is complete within 6 hours so that, if necessary, they can be given twice in one day without interfering with sleep. Following intravenous administration furosemide has a peak effect within 30 minutes. The diuresis associated with these drugs is dose related.

Torasemide has properties similar to those of furosemideand bumetanide, and is indicated for oedema and for hypertension.

Potassium-sparing diuretics and aldosterone antagonists

Amiloride hydrochloride and triamterene on their own are weak diuretics. They cause retention of potassium and are therefore given with thiazide or loop diuretics as a more effective alternative to potassium supplements. See compound preparations with thiazides or loop diuretics.

Potassium supplements must not be given with potassium- sparing diuretics. Administration of a potassium sparing diuretic to a patient receiving an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist can also cause severe hyperkalaemia.

Aldosterone antagonists

Spironolactone potentiates thiazide or loop diuretics by antagonising aldosterone; it is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Spironolactone is of value in the treatment of oedema and ascites caused by cirrhosis of the liver; furosemide can be used as an adjunct. Low doses of spironolactone are beneficial in moderate to severe heart failure and when used in resistant hypertension [unlicensed indication].

Spironolactone is also used in primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome). It is given before surgery or if surgery is not appropriate, in the lowest effective dose for maintenance.

Eplerenone is licensed for use as an adjunct in left ventricular dysfunction with evidence of heart failure after a myocardial infarction ; it is also licensed as an adjunct in chronic mild heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Potassium supplements must not be given with aldosterone antagonists

Potassium-sparing diuretics with other diuretics

Although it is preferable to prescribe thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics separately, the use of fixed combinations may be justified if compliance is a problem. Potassium-sparing diuretics are not usually necessary in the routine treatment of hypertension, unless hypokalaemia develops.

Other diuretics

Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can be used to treat cerebral oedema and raised intra-ocular pressure.

Mercurial diuretics are effective but are now almost never used because of their nephrotoxicity.

The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide is a weak diuretic and is little used for its diuretic effect. It is used for prophylaxis against mountain sickness [unlicensed indication] but is not a substitute for acclimatisation.

Acetazolamide and eye drops of dorzolamide and brinzolamide inhibit the formation of aqueous humour and are used in glaucoma.

Diuretics with potassium

Many patients on diuretics do not need potassium supplements. For many of those who do, the amount of potassium in combined preparations may not be enough, and for this reason their use is to be discouraged.

Diuretics with potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics should not usually be given together. Diuretics and potassium supplements should be prescribed separately for children.

Bromocriptine is used for the treatment of galactorrhoea, and for the treatment of prolactinomas (when it reduces both plasma prolactin concentration and tumour size). Bromocriptine also inhibits the release of growth hormone and is sometimes used in the treatment of acromegaly, but somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide) are more effective.

Cabergoline has similar side-effects to bromocriptine, however patients intolerant of bromocriptine may be able to tolerate cabergoline (and vice versa).

Quinagolide has actions and uses similar to those of ergot-derived dopamine agonists, but its side-effects differ slightly.

Suppression of lactation

Although bromocriptine and cabergoline are licensed to suppress lactation, they are not recommended for routine suppression (or for the relief of symptoms of postpartum pain and engorgement) that can be adequately treated with simple analgesics and breast support. If a dopamine-receptor agonist is required, cabergoline is preferred. Quinagolide is not licensed for the suppression of lactation.

    <p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. They have many uses and are generally well tolerated. The main indications of ACE inhibitors are shown below.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Heart Failure</p>
      <p>ACE inhibitors are used in all grades of heart failure, usually combined with a beta-blocker. Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics should be discontinued before introducing an ACE inhibitor because of the risk of hyperkalaemia. However, a low dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/spironolactone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP834\">spironolactone</xref> may be beneficial in severe heart failure and can be used with an ACE inhibitor provided serum potassium is monitored carefully. Profound first-dose hypotension may occur when ACE inhibitors are introduced to patients with heart failure who are already taking a high dose of a loop diuretic (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/furosemide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP815\">furosemide</xref> 80 mg daily or more). Temporary withdrawal of the loop diuretic reduces the risk, but may cause severe rebound pulmonary oedema. Therefore, for patients on high doses of loop diuretics, the ACE inhibitor may need to be initiated under specialist supervision. An ACE inhibitor can be initiated in the community in patients who are receiving a low dose of a diuretic or who are not otherwise at risk of serious hypotension; nevertheless, care is required and a very low dose of the ACE inhibitor is given initially.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypertension</p>
      <p>An ACE inhibitor may be the most appropriate initial drug for hypertension in younger Caucasian patients; Afro-Caribbean patients, those aged over 55 years, and those with primary aldosteronism respond less well.

    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Initiation under specialist supervision</p>
      <p>ACE inhibitors should be initiated under specialist supervision and with careful clinical monitoring in those with severe heart failure or in those:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>receiving multiple or high-dose diuretic therapy (e.g. more than 80 mg of furosemide daily or its equivalent);</li>
        <li>receiving concomitant angiotensin-II receptor antagonist or aliskiren;</li>
        <li>with hypovolaemia;</li>
        <li>with hyponatraemia (plasma-sodium concentration below 130 mmol/litre);</li>

      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Renal effects</p>
      <p>Renal function and electrolytes should be checked before starting ACE inhibitors (or increasing the dose) and monitored during treatment (more frequently if features mentioned below present); hyperkalaemia and other side-effects of ACE inhibitors are more common in those with impaired renal function and the dose may need to be reduced. Although ACE inhibitors now have a specialised role in some forms of renal disease, including chronic kidney disease, they also occasionally cause impairment of renal function which may progress and become severe in other circumstances (at particular risk are the elderly). A specialist should be involved if renal function is significantly reduced as a result of treatment with an ACE inhibitor.</p>
      <p>Concomitant treatment with NSAIDs increases the risk of renal damage, and potassium-sparing diuretics (or potassium-containing salt substitutes) increase the risk of hyperkalaemia.</p>
      <p>In patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis (or severe stenosis of the artery supplying a single functioning kidney), ACE inhibitors reduce or abolish glomerular filtration and are likely to cause severe and progressive renal failure. They are therefore not recommended in patients known to have these forms of critical renovascular disease.</p>
      <p>ACE inhibitor treatment is unlikely to have an adverse effect on overall renal function in patients with severe unilateral renal artery stenosis and a normal contralateral kidney, but glomerular filtration is likely to be reduced (or even abolished) in the affected kidney and the long-term consequences are unknown.</p>
      <p>ACE inhibitors are therefore best avoided in patients with known or suspected renovascular disease, unless the blood pressure cannot be controlled by other drugs. If ACE inhibitors are used, they should be initiated only under specialist supervision and renal function should be monitored regularly.</p>
      <p>ACE inhibitors should also be used with particular caution in patients who may have undiagnosed and clinically silent renovascular disease. This includes patients with peripheral vascular disease or those with severe generalised atherosclerosis.</p>

        <p>ACE inhibitors can cause a very rapid fall in blood pressure in volume-depleted patients; treatment should therefore be initiated with very low doses. If the dose of diuretic is greater than 80 mg <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/furosemide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP815\">furosemide</xref> or equivalent, the ACE inhibitor should be initiated under close supervision and in some patients the diuretic dose may need to be reduced or the diuretic discontinued at least 24 hours beforehand (may not be possible in heart failure—risk of pulmonary oedema). If high-dose diuretic therapy cannot be stopped, close observation is recommended after administration of the first dose of ACE inhibitor, for at least 2 hours or until the blood pressure has stabilised.</p>

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. They have many uses and are generally well tolerated. The main indications of ACE inhibitors are shown below.

Heart Failure

ACE inhibitors are used in all grades of heart failure, usually combined with a beta-blocker. Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics should be discontinued before introducing an ACE inhibitor because of the risk of hyperkalaemia. However, a low dose of spironolactone may be beneficial in severe heart failure and can be used with an ACE inhibitor provided serum potassium is monitored carefully.

Hypertension

An ACE inhibitor may be the most appropriate initial drug for hypertension in younger Caucasian patients; Afro-Caribbean patients, those aged over 55 years, and those with primary aldosteronism respond less well. ACE inhibitors are particularly indicated for hypertension in patients with type 1 diabetes with nephropathy. They may reduce blood pressure very rapidly in some patients particularly in those receiving diuretic therapy.

Diabetic nephropathy

ACE inhibitors have a role in the management of diabetic nephropathy.

Prophylaxis of cardiovascular events

ACE inhibitors are used in the early and long-term management of patients who have had a myocardial infarction. ACE inhibitors may also have a role in preventing cardiovascular events.

Initiation under specialist supervision

ACE inhibitors should be initiated under specialist supervision and with careful clinical monitoring in those with severe heart failure or in those:

receiving multiple or high-dose diuretic therapy (e.g. more than 80 mg of furosemide daily or its equivalent);receiving concomitant angiotensin-II receptor antagonist or aliskiren;with hypovolaemia;with hyponatraemia (plasma-sodium concentration below 130 mmol/litre);with hypotension (systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg);with unstable heart failure;receiving high-dose vasodilator therapy;known renovascular disease.Renal effects

Renal function and electrolytes should be checked before starting ACE inhibitors (or increasing the dose) and monitored during treatment (more frequently if features mentioned below present); hyperkalaemia and other side-effects of ACE inhibitors are more common in those with impaired renal function and the dose may need to be reduced.

A specialist should be involved if renal function is significantly reduced as a result of treatment with an ACE inhibitor.

Concomitant treatment with NSAIDs increases the risk of renal damage, and potassium-sparing diuretics (or potassium-containing salt substitutes) increase the risk of hyperkalaemia.

In patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis (or severe stenosis of the artery supplying a single functioning kidney), ACE inhibitors reduce or abolish glomerular filtration and are likely to cause severe and progressive renal failure. They are therefore not recommended in patients known to have these forms of critical renovascular disease.

ACE inhibitor treatment is unlikely to have an adverse effect on overall renal function in patients with severe unilateral renal artery stenosis and a normal contralateral kidney, but glomerular filtration is likely to be reduced (or even abolished) in the affected kidney and the long-term consequences are unknown.

ACE inhibitors are therefore best avoided in patients with known or suspected renovascular disease, unless the blood pressure cannot be controlled by other drugs. If ACE inhibitors are used, they should be initiated only under specialist supervision and renal function should be monitored regularly.

ACE inhibitors should also be used with particular caution in patients who may have undiagnosed and clinically silent renovascular disease. This includes patients with peripheral vascular disease or those with severe generalised atherosclerosis.

Cautions

ACE inhibitors need to be initiated with care in patients receiving diuretics.

Concomitant diuretics

ACE inhibitors can cause a very rapid fall in blood pressure in volume-depleted patients; treatment should therefore be initiated with very low doses. If the dose of diuretic is greater than 80 mg furosemide or equivalent, the ACE inhibitor should be initiated under close supervision and in some patients the diuretic dose may need to be reduced or the diuretic discontinued at least 24 hours beforehand (may not be possible in heart failure—risk of pulmonary oedema). If high-dose diuretic therapy cannot be stopped, close observation is recommended after administration of the first dose of ACE inhibitor, for at least 2 hours or until the blood pressure has stabilised.

Combination products

Products incorporating an ACE inhibitor with a thiazide diuretic or a calcium-channel blocker are available for the management of hypertension. Use of these combination products should be reserved for patients whose blood pressure has not responded adequately to a single antihypertensive drug and who have been stabilised on the individual components of the combination in the same proportions.

Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists

Azilsartan medoxomil, candesartan cilexetil, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan potassium, olmesartan medoxomil, telmisartan, and valsartan are angiotensin-II receptor antagonists with many properties similar to those of the ACE inhibitors. However, unlike ACE inhibitors, they do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin and other kinins, and thus are less likely to cause the persistent dry cough which can complicate ACE inhibitor therapy. They are therefore a useful alternative for patients who have to discontinue an ACE inhibitor because of persistent cough.

An angiotensin-II receptor antagonist may be used as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor in the management of heart failure or diabetic nephropathy. Candesartan cilexetil and valsartan are also licensed as adjuncts to ACE inhibitors under specialist supervision, in the management of heart failure when other treatments are unsuitable.

Renal effects

Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be used with caution in renal artery stenosis (see also Renal effects under ACE Inhibitors, above).

Renin inhibitor

Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor that is licensed for the treatment of hypertension.

Concomitant use of drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system

Combination therapy with two drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, and aliskiren is not recommended due to an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and renal impairment, compared to use of a single drug. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are particularly susceptible to developing hyperkalaemia and should not be given an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. There is some evidence that the benefits of combination use of an ACE inhibitor with candesartan or valsartan may outweigh the risks in selected patients with heart failure for whom other treatments are unsuitable, however, the concomitant use of this combination, together with an aldosterone antagonist or a potassium-sparing diuretic is not recommended.

Acute retention is painful and is treated by catheterisation.

Chronic retention is painless and often long-standing. Catheterisation is unnecessary unless there is deterioration of renal function. After the cause has initially been established and treated, drugs may be required to increase detrusor muscle tone.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is treated either surgically or medically with alpha-blockers. Dutasteride and finasteride are alternatives to alpha-blockers, particularly in men with a significantly enlarged prostate. Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, may also be used in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Alpha-blockers

The alpha1-selective alpha blockers, alfuzosin hydrochloride, doxazosin, indoramin, prazosin, tamsulosin hydrochloride and terazosin relax smooth muscle in benign prostatic hyperplasia producing an increase in urinary flow-rate and an improvement in obstructive symptoms.

Parasympathomimetics

The parasympathomimetic bethanechol chloride increases detrusor muscle contraction. However, it has only a limited role in the relief of urinary retention; its use has been superseded by catheterisation.

    <p>Otitis externa is an inflammatory reaction of the meatal skin. It is important to exclude an underlying chronic otitis media before treatment is commenced. Many cases recover after thorough cleansing of the external ear canal by suction or dry mopping.

    <p>Ear wax (cerumen) is a normal bodily secretion which provides a protective film on the meatal skin and need only be removed if it causes hearing loss or interferes with a proper view of the ear drum.</p>

If the wax is hard and impacted, the drops can be used twice daily for several days and this may reduce the need for mechanical removal of the wax. The patient should lie with the affected ear uppermost for 5 to 10 minutes after a generous amount of the softening remedy has been introduced into the ear. Some proprietary preparations containing organic solvents can irritate the meatal skin, and in most cases the simple remedies indicated above are just as effective and less likely to cause irritation. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/docusate-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP581\">Docusate sodium</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/urea-hydrogen-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP34510\">urea hydrogen peroxide</xref> are ingredients in a number of proprietary preparations for softening ear wax.</p>
    <p>If necessary, wax may be removed by irrigation with water (warmed to body temperature). Ear irrigation is generally best avoided in young children, in patients unable to co-operate with the procedure, in those with otitis media in the last six weeks, in otitis externa, in patients with cleft palate, a history of ear drum perforation, or previous ear surgery. A person who has hearing in one ear only should not have that ear irrigated because even a very slight risk of damage is unacceptable in this situation.</p>

If glue ear persists for more than a month or two, the child should be referred for assessment and follow up because of the risk of long-term hearing impairment which can delay language development. Untreated or resistant glue ear may be responsible for some types of chronic otitis media.

Chronic otitis media

Opportunistic organisms are often present in the debris, keratin, and necrotic bone of the middle ear and mastoid in patients with chronic otitis media. The mainstay of treatment is thorough cleansing with aural microsuction which may completely resolve long-standing infection. Local cleansing of the meatal and middle ear may be followed by treatment with a sponge wick or ribbon gauze dressing soaked with corticosteroid ear drops or with an astringent such as aluminium acetate solution; this is particularly beneficial for discharging ears or infections of the mastoid cavity. An antibacterial ear ointment may also be used. Acute exacerbations of chronic infection may also require systemic treatment with amoxicillin (or erythromycin if penicillin-allergic); treatment is adjusted according to the results of sensitivity testing.

In view of reports of ototoxicity, manufacturers contraindicate topical treatment with ototoxic antibacterials in the presence of a tympanic perforation or patent grommet. Ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops used in the ear [unlicensed use] or ear drops [both unlicensed; available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies] are an effective alternative to such ototoxic ear drops for chronic otitis media in patients with perforation of the tympanic membrane.

However, some specialists do use ear drops containing aminoglycosides or polymyxins [unlicensed indications] cautiously in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media and a perforation of the tympanic membrane, if the otitis media has failed to settle with systemic antibacterials; treatment should be considered only by specialists in the following circumstances:

drops should only be used in the presence of obvious infection;treatment should be for no longer than 2 weeks;patients should be counselled on the risk of ototoxicity and given justification for the use of these topical antibiotics;baseline audiometry should be performed, if possible, before treatment is commenced.Clinical expertise and judgement should be used to assess the risk of treatment versus the benefit to the patient in such circumstances. It is considered that the pus in the middle ear associated with otitis media also carries a risk of ototoxicity.

Removal of ear wax

Ear wax (cerumen) is a normal bodily secretion which provides a protective film on the meatal skin and need only be removed if it causes hearing loss or interferes with a proper view of the ear drum.

Ear wax can be softened using simple remedies such as olive oil ear drops or almond oil ear drops; sodium bicarbonate ear drops are also effective, but may cause dryness of the ear canal. If the wax is hard and impacted, the drops can be used twice daily for several days and this may reduce the need for mechanical removal of the wax. The patient should lie with the affected ear uppermost for 5 to 10 minutes after a generous amount of the softening remedy has been introduced into the ear. Some proprietary preparations containing organic solvents can irritate the meatal skin, and in most cases the simple remedies indicated above are just as effective and less likely to cause irritation. Docusate sodium or urea hydrogen peroxide are ingredients in a number of proprietary preparations for softening ear wax.

If necessary, wax may be removed by irrigation with water (warmed to body temperature). Ear irrigation is generally best avoided in young children, in patients unable to co-operate with the procedure, in those with otitis media in the last six weeks, in otitis externa, in patients with cleft palate, a history of ear drum perforation, or previous ear surgery. A person who has hearing in one ear only should not have that ear irrigated because even a very slight risk of damage is unacceptable in this situation.

Drugs affecting the immune response are used for eczema or psoriasis. Systemic drugs acting on the immune system are used under specialist supervision.

Pimecrolimus by topical application is licensed for mild to moderate atopic eczema. Tacrolimus is licensed for topical use in moderate to severe atopic eczema. Both are drugs whose long-term safety is still being evaluated and they should not usually be considered first-line treatments unless there is a specific reason to avoid or reduce the use of topical corticosteroids. Treatment of atopic eczema with topical pimecrolimus or topical tacrolimus should be initiated only by prescribers experienced in managing the condition. Topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have a role in the treatment of psoriasis.

A short course of a systemic corticosteroid can be given for eczema flares that have not improved despite appropriate topical treatment.

Ciclosporin by mouth can be used for severe psoriasis and for severe eczema. Azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil are used for severe refractory eczema [unlicensed indication].

Methotrexate can be used for severe psoriasis, the dose being adjusted according to severity of the condition and haematological and biochemical measurements. Folic acid should be given to reduce the possibility of side-effects associated with methotrexate. Folic acid can be given once weekly [unlicensed indication], on a different day from the methotrexate; alternative regimens of folic acid may be used in some settings.

Etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab inhibit the activity of tumour necrosis factor (TNFα). They are used for severe plaque psoriasis either refractory to at least 2 standard systemic treatments and photochemotherapy, or when standard treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications; while either etanercept or adalimumab is considered to be the first choice in stable disease, infliximab or adalimumab may be useful when rapid disease control is required. Ustekinumab (a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukins 12 and 23) can be used for severe plaque psoriasis that has not responded to at least 2 standard systemic treatments and photochemotherapy, or when these treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications. Adalimumab is also licensed for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) in patients who have had inadequate response to conventional systemic therapy. Adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab are also licensed for psoriatic arthritis.

Eczema (dermatitis) has several causes, which may influence treatment. The main types of eczema are irritant, allergic contact, atopic, venous and discoid; different types may co-exist. Lichenification, due to scratching and rubbing, may complicate any chronic eczema. Atopic eczema is the most common type and it usually involves dry skin as well as infection and lichenification.

Management of eczema involves the removal or treatment of contributory factors including occupational and domestic irritants. Known or suspected contact allergens should be avoided. Rarely, ingredients in topical medicinal products may sensitise the skin; the BNF lists active ingredients together with excipients that have been associated with skin sensitisation.

Skin dryness and the consequent irritant eczema requires emollients applied regularly (at least twice daily) and liberally to the affected area; this can be supplemented with bath or shower emollients. The use of emollients should continue even if the eczema improves or if other treatment is being used.

Topical corticosteroids are also required in the management of eczema; the potency of the corticosteroid should be appropriate to the severity and site of the condition. Mild corticosteroids are generally used on the face and on flexures; potent corticosteroids are generally required for use on adults with discoid or lichenified eczema or with eczema on the scalp, limbs, and trunk. Treatment should be reviewed regularly, especially if a potent corticosteroid is required. In patients with frequent flares (2–3 per month), a topical corticosteroid can be applied on 2 consecutive days each week to prevent further flares.

Bandages (including those containing ichthammol with zinc oxide) are sometimes applied over topical corticosteroids or emollients to treat eczema of the limbs. Dry-wrap dressings can be used to provide a physical barrier to help prevent scratching and improve retention of emollients. See Wound management products and elasticated garments for details of elasticated viscose stockinette tubular bandages and garments, and silk clothing.

See Eczema and psoriasis, drugs affecting the immune response for the role of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in atopic eczema.

Infection

Bacterial infection (commonly with Staphylococcus aureus and occasionally with Streptococcus pyogenes) can exacerbate eczema and requires treatment with topical or systemic antibacterial drugs. Antibacterial drugs should be used in short courses (typically 1 week) to reduce the risk of drug resistance or skin sensitisation. Associated eczema is treated simultaneously with a topical corticosteroid which can be combined with a topical antimicrobial.

Eczema involving widespread or recurrent infection requires the use of a systemic antibacterial that is active against the infecting organism. Products that combine an antiseptic with an emollient application and with a bath emollient can also be used; antiseptic shampoos can be used on the scalp.

Intertriginous eczema commonly involves candida and bacteria; it is best treated with a mild or moderately potent topical corticosteroid and a suitable antimicrobial drug.

Widespread herpes simplex infection may complicate atopic eczema and treatment with a systemic antiviral drug is indicated.

Management of other features of eczema

Lichenification, which results from repeated scratching is treated initially with a potent corticosteroid. Bandages containing ichthammol paste (to reduce pruritus) and other substances such as zinc oxide can be applied over the corticosteroid or emollient. Coal tar and ichthammol can be useful in some cases of chronic eczema.

A non-sedatingantihistamine may be of some value in relieving severe itching or urticaria associated with eczema. A sedating antihistamine can be used if itching causes sleep disturbance.

Exudative (‘weeping’) eczema requires a potent corticosteroid initially; infection may also be present and require specific treatment. Potassium permanganate solution (1 in 10,000) can be used in exudating eczema for its antiseptic and astringent effects; treatment should be stopped when exudation stops.

Severe refractory eczema

Severe refractory eczema is best managed under specialist supervision; it may require phototherapy or drugs that act on the immune system. Alitretinoin is licensed for the treatment of severe chronic hand eczema refractory to potent topical corticosteroids; patients with hyperkeratotic features are more likely to respond to alitretinoin than those with pompholyx.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis

Seborrhoeic dermatitis (seborrhoeic eczema) is associated with species of the yeast Malassezia and affects the scalp, paranasal areas, and eyebrows. Shampoos active against the yeast (including those containing ketoconazole and coal tar) and combinations of mild corticosteroids with suitable antimicrobials are used.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>These notes provide only an overview of the treatment of poisoning, and it is strongly recommended that either <b>TOXBASE</b> or the <b>UK National Poisons Information Service</b> be consulted when there is doubt about the degree of risk or about management.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Hospital admission</p>
      <p>Patients who have features of poisoning should generally be admitted to hospital. Patients who have taken poisons with delayed action should also be admitted, even if they appear well. Delayed-action poisons include <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>, iron, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref>, tricyclic antidepressants, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-phenotrope.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP464\">co-phenotrope</xref> (diphenoxylate with atropine, <i>Lomotil</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />); the effects of modified-release preparations are also delayed. A note of all relevant information, including what treatment has been given, should accompany the patient to hospital.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Further information</p>
    <p>
      <b>TOXBASE</b>, the primary clinical toxicology database of the National Poisons Information Service, is available on the internet to registered users at<xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.toxbase.org\">www.toxbase.org</xref> (a backup site is available at<xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.toxbasebackup.org\">www.toxbasebackup.org</xref> if the main site cannot be accessed). It provides information about routine diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients exposed to drugs, household products, and industrial and agricultural chemicals.</p>
    <p>Specialist information and advice on the treatment of poisoning is available day and night from the <b>UK National Poisons Information Service</b> on the following number: Tel: 0344 892 0111.</p>
    <p>Advice on laboratory analytical services can be obtained from TOXBASE or from the National Poisons Information Service. Help with identifying capsules or tablets may be available from a regional medicines information centre or from the National Poisons Information Service (out of hours).</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">General care</p>
    <p>It is often impossible to establish with certainty the identity of the poison and the size of the dose. This is not usually important because only a few poisons (such as opioids, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref>, and iron) have specific antidotes; few patients require active removal of the poison. In most patients, treatment is directed at managing symptoms as they arise. Nevertheless, knowledge of the type and timing of poisoning can help in anticipating the course of events. All relevant information should be sought from the poisoned individual and from carers or parents. However, such information should be interpreted with care because it may not be complete or entirely reliable. Sometimes symptoms arise from other illnesses and patients should be assessed carefully. Accidents may involve domestic and industrial products (the contents of which are not generally known). The <b>National Poisons Information Service</b> should be consulted when there is doubt about any aspect of suspected poisoning.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Respiration</p>
    <p>Respiration is often impaired in unconscious patients. An obstructed airway requires immediate attention. In the absence of trauma, the airway should be opened with simple measures such as chin lift or jaw thrust. An oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway may be useful in patients with reduced consciousness to prevent obstruction, provided ventilation is adequate. Intubation and ventilation should be considered in patients whose airway cannot be protected or who have respiratory acidosis because of inadequate ventilation; such patients should be monitored in a critical care area.</p>
    <p>Most poisons that impair consciousness also depress respiration. Assisted ventilation (either mouth-to-mouth or using a bag-valve-mask device) may be needed. Oxygen is not a substitute for adequate ventilation, although it should be given in the highest concentration possible in poisoning with carbon monoxide and irritant gases.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Blood pressure</p>
    <p>Hypotension is common in severe poisoning with central nervous system depressants. A systolic blood pressure of less than 70 mmHg may lead to irreversible brain damage or renal tubular necrosis. Hypotension should be corrected initially by raising the foot of the bed and administration of an infusion of either <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-chloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5143\">sodium chloride</xref> or a colloid. Vasoconstrictor sympathomimetics are rarely required and their use may be discussed with the National Poisons Information Service.</p>
    <p>Fluid depletion without hypotension is common after prolonged coma and after <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> poisoning due to vomiting, sweating, and hyperpnoea.</p>
    <p>Hypertension, often transient, occurs less frequently than hypotension in poisoning; it may be associated with sympathomimetic drugs such as amfetamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Heart</p>
    <p>Cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias can occur in acute poisoning, notably with tricyclic antidepressants, some antipsychotics, and some antihistamines. Arrhythmias often respond to correction of underlying hypoxia, acidosis, or other biochemical abnormalities, but ventricular arrhythmias that cause serious hypotension require treatment. If the QT interval is prolonged, specialist advice should be sought because the use of some anti-arrhythmic drugs may be inappropriate. Supraventricular arrhythmias are seldom life-threatening and drug treatment is best withheld until the patient reaches hospital.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Body temperature</p>
    <p>Hypothermia may develop in patients of any age who have been deeply unconscious for some hours, particularly following overdose with barbiturates or phenothiazines. It may be missed unless core temperature is measured using a low-reading rectal thermometer or by some other means. Hypothermia should be managed by prevention of further heat loss and appropriate re-warming as clinically indicated.</p>
    <p>Hyperthermia can develop in patients taking CNS stimulants; children and the elderly are also at risk when taking therapeutic doses of drugs with antimuscarinic properties. Hyperthermia is initially managed by removing all unnecessary clothing and using a fan. Sponging with <b>tepid</b> water will promote evaporation. Advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service on the management of severe hyperthermia resulting from conditions such as the serotonin syndrome.</p>
    <p>Both hypothermia and hyperthermia require <b>urgent</b> hospitalisation for assessment and supportive treatment.</p>

      <p>Given by mouth, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/charcoal-activated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP182\">charcoal, activated</xref> can bind many poisons in the gastro-intestinal system, thereby reducing their absorption. The <b>sooner</b> it is given the <b>more effective</b> it is, but it may still be effective up to 1 hour after ingestion of the poison—longer in the case of modified-release preparations or of drugs with antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) properties. It is particularly useful for the prevention of absorption of poisons that are toxic in small amounts, such as antidepressants.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Active elimination techniques</p>
      <p>Repeated doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/charcoal-activated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP182\">charcoal, activated</xref> by mouth <i>enhance the elimination</i> of some drugs after they have been absorbed; repeated doses are given after overdosage with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Carbamazepine</li>
        <li>Dapsone</li>
        <li>Phenobarbital</li>
        <li>Quinine</li>
        <li>Theophylline</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If vomiting occurs after dosing it should be treated (e.g. with an antiemetic drug) since it may reduce the efficacy of charcoal treatment. In cases of intolerance, the dose may be reduced and the frequency increased but this may compromise efficacy.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/charcoal-activated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP182\">Charcoal, activated</xref> should <b>not</b> be used for poisoning with petroleum distillates, corrosive substances, alcohols, malathion, cyanides and metal salts including iron and lithium salts.</p>
      <p>Other techniques intended to enhance the elimination of poisons after absorption are only practicable in hospital and are only suitable for a small number of severely poisoned patients. Moreover, they only apply to a limited number of poisons. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>haemodialysis for ethylene glycol, lithium, methanol, phenobarbital, salicylates, and sodium valproate;</li>
        <li>alkalinisation of the urine for salicylates.</li>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Removal from the gastro-intestinal tract</p>
      <p>Gastric lavage is rarely required; for substances that cannot be removed effectively by other means (e.g. iron), it should be considered only if a life-threatening amount has been ingested within the previous hour. It should be carried out only if the airway can be protected adequately. Gastric lavage is contra-indicated if a corrosive substance or a petroleum distillate has been ingested, but it may occasionally be considered in patients who have ingested drugs that are not adsorbed by charcoal, such as iron or lithium. Induction of <i>emesis</i> (e.g. with ipecacuanha) is <b>not</b> recommended because there is no evidence that it affects absorption and it may increase the risk of aspiration.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Whole bowel irrigation</i> (by means of a bowel cleansing preparation) has been used in poisoning with certain modified-release or enteric-coated formulations, in severe poisoning with iron and lithium salts, and if illicit drugs are carried in the gastro-intestinal tract (‘body-packing’). However, it is not clear that the procedure improves outcome and advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Alcohol</p>
    <p>Acute intoxication with alcohol (ethanol) is common in adults but also occurs in children. The features include ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and drowsiness, which may progress to coma, with hypotension and acidosis. Aspiration of vomit is a special hazard and hypoglycaemia may occur in children and some adults. Patients are managed supportively, with particular attention to maintaining a clear airway and measures to reduce the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. The blood glucose is measured and glucose given if indicated.</p>

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Aspirin</p>
    <p>The main features of salicylate poisoning are hyperventilation, tinnitus, deafness, vasodilatation, and sweating. Coma is uncommon but indicates very severe poisoning. The associated acid-base disturbances are complex.</p>
    <p>Treatment must be in hospital, where plasma salicylate, pH, and electrolytes can be measured; absorption of aspirin may be slow and the plasma-salicylate concentration may continue to rise for several hours, requiring repeated measurement. Plasma-salicylate concentration may not correlate with clinical severity in the young and the elderly, and clinical and biochemical assessment is necessary. Generally, the clinical severity of poisoning is less below a plasma-salicylate concentration of 500 mg/litre (3.6 mmol/litre), unless there is evidence of metabolic acidosis. Activated charcoal can be given within 1 hour of ingesting more than 125 mg/kg of aspirin. Fluid losses should be replaced and intravenous sodium bicarbonate may be given (ensuring plasma-potassium concentration is within the reference range) to enhance urinary salicylate excretion (optimum urinary pH 7.5–8.5).</p>
    <p>Plasma-potassium concentration should be corrected before giving sodium bicarbonate as hypokalaemia may complicate alkalinisation of the urine.</p>
    <p>Haemodialysis is the treatment of choice for severe salicylate poisoning and should be considered when the plasma-salicylate concentration exceeds 700 mg/litre (5.1 mmol/litre) or in the presence of severe metabolic acidosis.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Opioids</p>
    <p>Opioids (narcotic analgesics) cause coma, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils. The specific antidote <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/naloxone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP202\">naloxone hydrochloride</xref> is indicated if there is coma or bradypnoea. Since naloxone has a shorter duration of action than many opioids, close monitoring and repeated injections are necessary according to the respiratory rate and depth of coma. When repeated administration of naloxone is required, it can be given by continuous intravenous infusion instead and the rate of infusion adjusted according to vital signs. The effects of some opioids, such as buprenorphine, are only partially reversed by naloxone. Dextropropoxyphene and methadone have very long durations of action; patients may need to be monitored for long periods following large overdoses.</p>
    <p>Naloxone reverses the opioid effects of dextropropoxyphene. The long duration of action of dextropropoxyphene calls for prolonged monitoring and further doses of naloxone may be required. Norpropoxyphene, a metabolite of dextropropoxyphene, also has cardiotoxic effects which may require treatment with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-bicarbonate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5118\">sodium bicarbonate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/magnesium-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6120\">magnesium sulfate</xref>, or both.

    <p>Toxic doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> may cause severe hepatocellular necrosis and, much less frequently, renal tubular necrosis. Nausea and vomiting, the only early features of poisoning, usually settle within 24 hours. Persistence beyond this time, often associated with the onset of right subcostal pain and tenderness, usually indicates development of hepatic necrosis. Liver damage is maximal 3–4 days after <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> overdose and may lead to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, and death. Therefore, despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients who have taken an overdose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> should be transferred to hospital urgently.</p>
    <p>To avoid underestimating the potentially toxic <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> dose ingested by obese patients who weigh more than 110 kg, use a body-weight of 110 kg (rather than their actual body-weight) when calculating the total dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> ingested (in mg/kg).</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The prognostic accuracy of a plasma-paracetamol concentration taken after 15 hours is uncertain, but a concentration on or above the <i>treatment line</i> on the <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> treatment graph should be regarded as carrying a serious risk of liver damage.

      <p outputclass=\"title\">‘Staggered’ overdose, uncertain time of overdose, or therapeutic excess</p>

Therapeutic excess is the inadvertent ingestion of a potentially toxic dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> during its clinical use. The <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> treatment graph is unreliable if a ‘staggered’ overdose is taken, if there is uncertainty about the time of the overdose, or if there is therapeutic excess. In these cases, patients who have taken more than 150 mg/kg of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> in any 24-hour period are at risk of toxicity and should be commenced on <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/acetylcysteine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP195\">acetylcysteine</xref> immediately, unless it is more than 24 hours since the last ingestion, the patient is asymptomatic, the plasma-paracetamol concentration is undetectable, and liver function tests, serum creatinine and INR are normal.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Tricyclic and related antidepressants</p>
      <p>Tricyclic and related antidepressants cause dry mouth, coma of varying degree, hypotension, hypothermia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, convulsions, respiratory failure, cardiac conduction defects, and arrhythmias. Dilated pupils and urinary retention also occur. Metabolic acidosis may complicate severe poisoning; delirium with confusion, agitation, and visual and auditory hallucinations are common during recovery.</p>
      <p>Assessment in hospital is strongly advised in case of poisoning by tricyclic and related antidepressants but symptomatic treatment can be given before transfer. Supportive measures to ensure a clear airway and adequate ventilation during transfer are mandatory. Intravenous lorazepam or intravenous diazepam (preferably in emulsion form) may be required to treat convulsions. Activated charcoal given within 1 hour of the overdose reduces absorption of the drug. Although arrhythmias are worrying, some will respond to correction of hypoxia and acidosis. The use of anti-arrhythmic drugs is best avoided, but intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate can arrest arrhythmias or prevent them in those with an extended QRS duration. Diazepam given by mouth is usually adequate to sedate delirious patients but large doses may be required.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</p>
      <p>Symptoms of poisoning by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors include nausea, vomiting, agitation, tremor, nystagmus, drowsiness, and sinus tachycardia; convulsions may occur. Rarely, severe poisoning results in the serotonin syndrome, with marked neuropsychiatric effects, neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic instability; hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and coagulopathies may develop.</p>
      <p>Management of SSRI poisoning is supportive. Activated charcoal given within 1 hour of the overdose reduces absorption of the drug. Convulsions can be treated with lorazepam, diazepam, or midazolam oromucosal solution [unlicensed use in adults and children under 3 months] (see <i>Convulsions</i>). Contact the National Poisons Information Service for the management of hyperthermia or the serotonin syndrome.</p>

      <p>Phenothiazines cause less depression of consciousness and respiration than other sedatives. Hypotension, hypothermia, sinus tachycardia, and arrhythmias may complicate poisoning. Dystonic reactions can occur with therapeutic doses (particularly with prochlorperazine and trifluoperazine), and convulsions may occur in severe cases. Arrhythmias may respond to correction of hypoxia, acidosis, and other biochemical abnormalities, but specialist advice should be sought if arrhythmias result from a prolonged QT interval; the use of some anti-arrhythmic drugs can worsen such arrhythmias. Dystonic reactions are rapidly abolished by injection of drugs such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/procyclidine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3148\">procyclidine hydrochloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diazepam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2159\">diazepam</xref> (emulsion preferred).</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Benzodiazepines</p>
    <p>Benzodiazepines taken alone cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and occasionally respiratory depression, and coma. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/charcoal-activated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP182\">Charcoal, activated</xref> can be given within 1 hour of ingesting a significant quantity of benzodiazepine, provided the patient is awake and the airway is protected.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Beta blockers</p>
    <p>Therapeutic overdosages with beta-blockers may cause lightheadedness, dizziness, and possibly syncope as a result of bradycardia and hypotension; heart failure may be precipitated or exacerbated. These complications are most likely in patients with conduction system disorders or impaired myocardial function. Bradycardia is the most common arrhythmia caused by beta-blockers, but sotalol may induce ventricular tachyarrhythmias (sometimes of the torsade de pointes type). The effects of massive overdosage can vary from one beta-blocker to another; propranolol overdosage in particular may cause coma and convulsions.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Acute massive overdosage</i> must be managed in hospital and expert advice should be obtained. Maintenance of a clear airway and adequate ventilation is mandatory. An intravenous injection of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atropine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP356\">atropine sulfate</xref> is required to treat bradycardia. Cardiogenic shock unresponsive to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atropine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP356\">atropine sulfate</xref> is probably best treated with an intravenous injection of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glucagon.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4226\">glucagon</xref> [unlicensed] in glucose 5% (with precautions to protect the airway in case of vomiting) followed by an intravenous infusion. If <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glucagon.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4226\">glucagon</xref> is not available, intravenous isoprenaline (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is an alternative.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Calcium-channel blockers</p>
    <p>Features of calcium-channel blocker poisoning include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, agitation, confusion, and coma in severe poisoning. Metabolic acidosis and hyperglycaemia may occur. Verapamil and diltiazem have a profound cardiac depressant effect causing hypotension and arrhythmias, including complete heart block and asystole. The dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers cause severe hypotension secondary to profound peripheral vasodilatation.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/charcoal-activated.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP182\">Charcoal, activated</xref> should be considered if the patient presents within 1 hour of overdosage with a calcium-channel blocker; repeated doses of activated charcoal are considered if a modified-release preparation is involved. In patients with significant features of poisoning, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/calcium-chloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP93603\">calcium chloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/calcium-gluconate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP93600\">calcium gluconate</xref> is given by injection; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atropine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP356\">atropine sulfate</xref> is given to correct symptomatic bradycardia. In severe cases, an insulin and glucose infusion may be required in the management of hypotension and myocardial failure. For the management of hypotension, the choice of inotropic sympathomimetic depends on whether hypotension is secondary to vasodilatation or to myocardial depression—advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Iron salts</p>
    <p>Iron poisoning in childhood is usually accidental. The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, haematemesis, and rectal bleeding. Hypotension and hepatocellular necrosis can occur later. Coma, shock, and metabolic acidosis indicate severe poisoning.</p>
    <p>Advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service if a significant quantity of iron has been ingested within the previous hour.</p>
    <p>Mortality is reduced by intensive and specific therapy with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/desferrioxamine-mesilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP213\">desferrioxamine mesilate</xref>, which chelates iron. The serum-iron concentration is measured as an emergency and intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/desferrioxamine-mesilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP213\">desferrioxamine mesilate</xref> given to chelate absorbed iron in excess of the expected iron binding capacity. In severe toxicity intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/desferrioxamine-mesilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP213\">desferrioxamine mesilate</xref> should be given immediately without waiting for the result of the serum-iron measurement.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Lithium</p>
    <p>Most cases of lithium intoxication occur as a complication of long-term therapy and are caused by reduced excretion of the drug because of a variety of factors including dehydration, deterioration of renal function, infections, and co-administration of diuretics or NSAIDs (or other drugs that interact). Acute deliberate overdoses may also occur with delayed onset of symptoms (12 hours or more) owing to slow entry of lithium into the tissues and continuing absorption from modified-release formulations.</p>
    <p>The early clinical features are non-specific and may include apathy and restlessness which could be confused with mental changes arising from the patient's depressive illness. Vomiting, diarrhoea, ataxia, weakness, dysarthria, muscle twitching, and tremor may follow. Severe poisoning is associated with convulsions, coma, renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and hypotension.</p>
    <p>Therapeutic serum-lithium concentrations are within the range of 0.4–1 mmol/litre; concentrations in excess of 2 mmol/litre are usually associated with serious toxicity and such cases may need treatment with haemodialysis if neurological symptoms or renal failure are present. In acute overdosage much higher serum-lithium concentrations may be present without features of toxicity and all that is usually necessary is to take measures to increase urine output (e.g. by increasing fluid intake but avoiding diuretics). Otherwise, treatment is supportive with special regard to electrolyte balance, renal function, and control of convulsions. Gastric lavage may be considered if it can be performed within 1 hour of ingesting significant quantities of lithium. Whole-bowel irrigation should be considered for significant ingestion, but advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Ecstasy</p>
      <p>Ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamfetamine, MDMA) may cause severe reactions, even at doses that were previously tolerated. The most serious effects are delirium, coma, convulsions, ventricular arrhythmias, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, acute hepatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, adult respiratory distress syndrome, hyperreflexia, hypotension and intracerebral haemorrhage; hyponatraemia has also been associated with ecstasy use.</p>
      <p>Treatment of methylenedioxymethamfetamine poisoning is supportive, with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diazepam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2159\">diazepam</xref> to control severe agitation or persistent convulsions and close monitoring including ECG. Self-induced water intoxication should be considered in patients with ecstasy poisoning.</p>

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Theophylline</p>
    <p>Theophylline and related drugs are often prescribed as modified-release formulations and toxicity can therefore be delayed. They cause vomiting (which may be severe and intractable), agitation, restlessness, dilated pupils, sinus tachycardia, and hyperglycaemia. More serious effects are haematemesis, convulsions, and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Severe hypokalaemia may develop rapidly.</p>
    <p>Repeated doses of activated charcoal can be used to eliminate theophylline even if more than 1 hour has elapsed after ingestion and especially if a modified-release preparation has been taken (see also under Active Elimination Techniques). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ondansetron.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2561\">Ondansetron</xref> may be effective for severe vomiting that is resistant to other antiemetics [unlicensed indication]. Hypokalaemia is corrected by intravenous infusion of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/potassium-chloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5965\">potassium chloride</xref> and may be so severe as to require 60 mmol/hour (high doses require ECG monitoring).

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Organophosphorus insecticides</p>
      <p>Organophosphorus insecticides are usually supplied as powders or dissolved in organic solvents. All are absorbed through the bronchi and intact skin as well as through the gut and inhibit cholinesterase activity, thereby prolonging and intensifying the effects of acetylcholine. Toxicity between different compounds varies considerably, and onset may be delayed after skin exposure.</p>
      <p>Anxiety, restlessness, dizziness, headache, miosis, nausea, hypersalivation, vomiting, abdominal colic, diarrhoea, bradycardia, and sweating are common features of organophosphorus poisoning. Muscle weakness and fasciculation may develop and progress to generalised flaccid paralysis, including the ocular and respiratory muscles. Convulsions, coma, pulmonary oedema with copious bronchial secretions, hypoxia, and arrhythmias occur in severe cases. Hyperglycaemia and glycosuria without ketonuria may also be present.</p>
      <p>Further absorption of the organophosphorus insecticide should be prevented by moving the patient to fresh air, removing soiled clothing, and washing contaminated skin. In severe poisoning it is vital to ensure a clear airway, frequent removal of bronchial secretions, and adequate ventilation and oxygenation; gastric lavage may be considered provided that the airway is protected. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atropine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP356\">Atropine sulfate</xref> will reverse the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine and is given by intravenous injection until the skin becomes flushed and dry, the pupils dilate, and bradycardia is abolished.</p>

Many exotic snakes are kept, some illegally, but the only indigenous venomous snake is the adder (<ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i><i>Vipera berus</i></i></ph>). The bite may cause local and systemic effects. Local effects include pain, swelling, bruising, and tender enlargement of regional lymph nodes. Systemic effects include early anaphylactic symptoms (transient hypotension with syncope, angioedema, urticaria, abdominal colic, diarrhoea, and vomiting), with later persistent or recurrent hypotension, ECG abnormalities, spontaneous systemic bleeding, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and acute renal failure. Fatal envenoming is rare but the potential for severe envenoming must not be underestimated.</p>

      <p>Stings from ants, wasps, hornets, and bees cause local pain and swelling but seldom cause severe direct toxicity unless many stings are inflicted at the same time. If the sting is in the mouth or on the tongue local swelling may threaten the upper airway. The stings from these insects are usually treated by cleaning the area with a topical antiseptic. Bee stings should be removed as quickly as possible.

These notes provide only an overview of the treatment of poisoning, and it is strongly recommended that either TOXBASE or the UK National Poisons Information Service be consulted when there is doubt about the degree of risk or about management.

Hospital admission

Patients who have features of poisoning should generally be admitted to hospital. Patients who have taken poisons with delayed action should also be admitted, even if they appear well. Delayed-action poisons include aspirin, iron, paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants, and co-phenotrope (diphenoxylate with atropine, Lomotil); the effects of modified-release preparations are also delayed. A note of all relevant information, including what treatment has been given, should accompany the patient to hospital.

Further information

TOXBASE, the primary clinical toxicology database of the National Poisons Information Service, is available on the internet to registered users atwww.toxbase.org (a backup site is available atwww.toxbasebackup.org if the main site cannot be accessed). It provides information about routine diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients exposed to drugs, household products, and industrial and agricultural chemicals.

Specialist information and advice on the treatment of poisoning is available day and night from the UK National Poisons Information Service on the following number: Tel: 0344 892 0111.

Advice on laboratory analytical services can be obtained from TOXBASE or from the National Poisons Information Service. Help with identifying capsules or tablets may be available from a regional medicines information centre or from the National Poisons Information Service (out of hours).

General care

It is often impossible to establish with certainty the identity of the poison and the size of the dose. This is not usually important because only a few poisons (such as opioids, paracetamol, and iron) have specific antidotes; few patients require active removal of the poison. In most patients, treatment is directed at managing symptoms as they arise. Nevertheless, knowledge of the type and timing of poisoning can help in anticipating the course of events. All relevant information should be sought from the poisoned individual and from carers or parents. However, such information should be interpreted with care because it may not be complete or entirely reliable. Sometimes symptoms arise from other illnesses and patients should be assessed carefully. Accidents may involve domestic and industrial products (the contents of which are not generally known). The National Poisons Information Service should be consulted when there is doubt about any aspect of suspected poisoning.

Respiration

Respiration is often impaired in unconscious patients. An obstructed airway requires immediate attention. In the absence of trauma, the airway should be opened with simple measures such as chin lift or jaw thrust. An oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway may be useful in patients with reduced consciousness to prevent obstruction, provided ventilation is adequate. Intubation and ventilation should be considered in patients whose airway cannot be protected or who have respiratory acidosis because of inadequate ventilation; such patients should be monitored in a critical care area.

Most poisons that impair consciousness also depress respiration. Assisted ventilation (either mouth-to-mouth or using a bag-valve-mask device) may be needed. Oxygen is not a substitute for adequate ventilation, although it should be given in the highest concentration possible in poisoning with carbon monoxide and irritant gases.

Blood pressure

Hypotension is common in severe poisoning with central nervous system depressants. A systolic blood pressure of less than 70 mmHg may lead to irreversible brain damage or renal tubular necrosis. Hypotension should be corrected initially by raising the foot of the bed and administration of an infusion of either sodium chloride or a colloid. Vasoconstrictor sympathomimetics are rarely required and their use may be discussed with the National Poisons Information Service.

Fluid depletion without hypotension is common after prolonged coma and after aspirin poisoning due to vomiting, sweating, and hyperpnoea.

Hypertension, often transient, occurs less frequently than hypotension in poisoning; it may be associated with sympathomimetic drugs such as amfetamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine.

Heart

Cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias can occur in acute poisoning, notably with tricyclic antidepressants, some antipsychotics, and some antihistamines. Arrhythmias often respond to correction of underlying hypoxia, acidosis, or other biochemical abnormalities, but ventricular arrhythmias that cause serious hypotension require treatment. If the QT interval is prolonged, specialist advice should be sought because the use of some anti-arrhythmic drugs may be inappropriate. Supraventricular arrhythmias are seldom life-threatening and drug treatment is best withheld until the patient reaches hospital.

Body temperature

Hypothermia may develop in patients of any age who have been deeply unconscious for some hours, particularly following overdose with barbiturates or phenothiazines. It may be missed unless core temperature is measured using a low-reading rectal thermometer or by some other means. Hypothermia should be managed by prevention of further heat loss and appropriate re-warming as clinically indicated.

Hyperthermia can develop in patients taking CNS stimulants; children and the elderly are also at risk when taking therapeutic doses of drugs with antimuscarinic properties. Hyperthermia is initially managed by removing all unnecessary clothing and using a fan. Sponging with tepid water will promote evaporation. Advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service on the management of severe hyperthermia resulting from conditions such as the serotonin syndrome.

Both hypothermia and hyperthermia require urgent hospitalisation for assessment and supportive treatment.

Convulsions

Single short-lived convulsions (lasting less than 5 minutes) do not require treatment. If convulsions are protracted or recur frequently, lorazepam or diazepam (preferably as emulsion) should be given by slow intravenous injection into a large vein. Benzodiazepines should not be given by the intramuscular route for convulsions. If the intravenous route is not readily available, midazolam oromucosal solution [unlicensed use in adults and children under 3 months] can be given by the buccal route or diazepam can be administered as a rectal solution.

Methaemoglobinaemia

Drug- or chemical-induced methaemoglobinaemia should be treated with methylthioninium chloride if the methaemoglobin concentration is 30% or higher, or if symptoms of tissue hypoxia are present despite oxygen therapy. Methylthioninium chloride reduces the ferric iron of methaemoglobin back to the ferrous iron of haemoglobin; in high doses, methylthioninium chloride can itself cause methaemoglobinaemia.

Removal and elimination

Prevention of absorption

Given by mouth, charcoal, activated can bind many poisons in the gastro-intestinal system, thereby reducing their absorption. The sooner it is given the more effective it is, but it may still be effective up to 1 hour after ingestion of the poison—longer in the case of modified-release preparations or of drugs with antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) properties. It is particularly useful for the prevention of absorption of poisons that are toxic in small amounts, such as antidepressants.

Active elimination techniques

Repeated doses of charcoal, activated by mouth enhance the elimination of some drugs after they have been absorbed; repeated doses are given after overdosage with:

CarbamazepineDapsonePhenobarbitalQuinineTheophyllineIf vomiting occurs after dosing it should be treated (e.g. with an antiemetic drug) since it may reduce the efficacy of charcoal treatment. In cases of intolerance, the dose may be reduced and the frequency increased but this may compromise efficacy.

Charcoal, activated should not be used for poisoning with petroleum distillates, corrosive substances, alcohols, malathion, cyanides and metal salts including iron and lithium salts.

Other techniques intended to enhance the elimination of poisons after absorption are only practicable in hospital and are only suitable for a small number of severely poisoned patients. Moreover, they only apply to a limited number of poisons. Examples include:

haemodialysis for ethylene glycol, lithium, methanol, phenobarbital, salicylates, and sodium valproate;alkalinisation of the urine for salicylates.Removal from the gastro-intestinal tract

Gastric lavage is rarely required; for substances that cannot be removed effectively by other means (e.g. iron), it should be considered only if a life-threatening amount has been ingested within the previous hour. It should be carried out only if the airway can be protected adequately. Gastric lavage is contra-indicated if a corrosive substance or a petroleum distillate has been ingested, but it may occasionally be considered in patients who have ingested drugs that are not adsorbed by charcoal, such as iron or lithium. Induction of emesis (e.g. with ipecacuanha) is not recommended because there is no evidence that it affects absorption and it may increase the risk of aspiration.

Whole bowel irrigation (by means of a bowel cleansing preparation) has been used in poisoning with certain modified-release or enteric-coated formulations, in severe poisoning with iron and lithium salts, and if illicit drugs are carried in the gastro-intestinal tract (‘body-packing’). However, it is not clear that the procedure improves outcome and advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.

Alcohol

Acute intoxication with alcohol (ethanol) is common in adults but also occurs in children. The features include ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and drowsiness, which may progress to coma, with hypotension and acidosis. Aspiration of vomit is a special hazard and hypoglycaemia may occur in children and some adults. Patients are managed supportively, with particular attention to maintaining a clear airway and measures to reduce the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. The blood glucose is measured and glucose given if indicated.

Aspirin

The main features of salicylate poisoning are hyperventilation, tinnitus, deafness, vasodilatation, and sweating. Coma is uncommon but indicates very severe poisoning. The associated acid-base disturbances are complex.

Treatment must be in hospital, where plasma salicylate, pH, and electrolytes can be measured; absorption of aspirin may be slow and the plasma-salicylate concentration may continue to rise for several hours, requiring repeated measurement. Plasma-salicylate concentration may not correlate with clinical severity in the young and the elderly, and clinical and biochemical assessment is necessary. Generally, the clinical severity of poisoning is less below a plasma-salicylate concentration of 500 mg/litre (3.6 mmol/litre), unless there is evidence of metabolic acidosis. Activated charcoal can be given within 1 hour of ingesting more than 125 mg/kg of aspirin. Fluid losses should be replaced and intravenous sodium bicarbonate may be given (ensuring plasma-potassium concentration is within the reference range) to enhance urinary salicylate excretion (optimum urinary pH 7.5–8.5).

Plasma-potassium concentration should be corrected before giving sodium bicarbonate as hypokalaemia may complicate alkalinisation of the urine.

Haemodialysis is the treatment of choice for severe salicylate poisoning and should be considered when the plasma-salicylate concentration exceeds 700 mg/litre (5.1 mmol/litre) or in the presence of severe metabolic acidosis.

Opioids

Opioids (narcotic analgesics) cause coma, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils. The specific antidote naloxone hydrochloride is indicated if there is coma or bradypnoea. Since naloxone has a shorter duration of action than many opioids, close monitoring and repeated injections are necessary according to the respiratory rate and depth of coma. When repeated administration of naloxone is required, it can be given by continuous intravenous infusion instead and the rate of infusion adjusted according to vital signs. The effects of some opioids, such as buprenorphine, are only partially reversed by naloxone. Dextropropoxyphene and methadone have very long durations of action; patients may need to be monitored for long periods following large overdoses.

Naloxone reverses the opioid effects of dextropropoxyphene. The long duration of action of dextropropoxyphene calls for prolonged monitoring and further doses of naloxone may be required. Norpropoxyphene, a metabolite of dextropropoxyphene, also has cardiotoxic effects which may require treatment with sodium bicarbonate or magnesium sulfate, or both. Arrhythmias may occur for up to 12 hours.

Paracetamol

In cases of intravenous paracetamol poisoning contact the National Poisons Information Service for advice on risk assessment and management.

Toxic doses of paracetamol may cause severe hepatocellular necrosis and, much less frequently, renal tubular necrosis. Nausea and vomiting, the only early features of poisoning, usually settle within 24 hours. Persistence beyond this time, often associated with the onset of right subcostal pain and tenderness, usually indicates development of hepatic necrosis. Liver damage is maximal 3–4 days after paracetamol overdose and may lead to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, and death. Therefore, despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients who have taken an overdose of paracetamol should be transferred to hospital urgently.

To avoid underestimating the potentially toxic paracetamol dose ingested by obese patients who weigh more than 110 kg, use a body-weight of 110 kg (rather than their actual body-weight) when calculating the total dose of paracetamol ingested (in mg/kg).

Acetylcysteine protects the liver if infused up to, and possibly beyond, 24 hours of ingesting paracetamol. It is most effective if given within 8 hours of ingestion, after which effectiveness declines. Very rarely, giving acetylcysteine by mouth [unlicensed route] is an alternative if intravenous access is not possible—contact the National Poisons Information Service for advice.

Neonates less than 45 weeks corrected gestational age may be more susceptible to paracetamol-induced liver toxicity, therefore, treatment with acetylcysteine should be considered in all paracetamol overdoses, and advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.

Acute overdose

Hepatotoxicity may occur after a single ingestion of more than 150 mg/kg paracetamol taken in less than 1 hour. Rarely, hepatotoxicity may develop with single ingestions as low as 75 mg/kg of paracetamol taken in less than 1 hour. Patients who have ingested 75 mg/kg or more of paracetamol in less than 1 hour should be referred to hospital. Administration of charcoal, activated should be considered if paracetamol in excess of 150 mg/kg is thought to have been ingested within the previous hour.

Patients at risk of liver damage and, therefore, requiring acetylcysteine, can be identified from a single measurement of the plasma-paracetamol concentration, related to the time from ingestion, provided this time interval is not less than 4 hours; earlier samples may be misleading. The concentration is plotted on a paracetamol treatment graph, with a reference line (‘treatment line’) joining plots of 100 mg/litre (0.66 mmol/litre) at 4 hours and 3.13 mg/litre (0.02 mmol/litre) at 24 hours. Acetylcysteine treatment should commence immediately in patients:

whose plasma-paracetamol concentration falls on or above the treatment line on the paracetamol treatment graph;who present 8–24 hours after taking an acute overdose of more than 150 mg/kg of paracetamol, even if the plasma-paracetamol concentration is not yet available; acetylcysteine can be discontinued if the plasma-paracetamol concentration is later reported to be below the treatment line on the paracetamol treatment graph,provided that the patient is asymptomatic and liver function tests, serum creatinine and INR are normal.The prognostic accuracy of a plasma-paracetamol concentration taken after 15 hours is uncertain, but a concentration on or above the treatment line on the paracetamol treatment graph should be regarded as carrying a serious risk of liver damage. If more than 15 hours have elapsed since ingestion, or there is doubt about appropriate management, advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.

‘Staggered’ overdose, uncertain time of overdose, or therapeutic excess

A ‘staggered’ overdose involves ingestion of a potentially toxic dose of paracetamol over more than one hour, with the possible intention of causing self-harm. Therapeutic excess is the inadvertent ingestion of a potentially toxic dose of paracetamol during its clinical use. The paracetamol treatment graph is unreliable if a ‘staggered’ overdose is taken, if there is uncertainty about the time of the overdose, or if there is therapeutic excess. In these cases, patients who have taken more than 150 mg/kg of paracetamol in any 24-hour period are at risk of toxicity and should be commenced on acetylcysteine immediately, unless it is more than 24 hours since the last ingestion, the patient is asymptomatic, the plasma-paracetamol concentration is undetectable, and liver function tests, serum creatinine and INR are normal.

Rarely, toxicity can occur with paracetamol doses between 75–150 mg/kg in any 24-hour period; clinical judgement of the individual case is necessary to determine whether to treat those who have ingested this amount of paracetamol. For small adults, this may be within the licensed dose, but ingestion of a licensed dose of paracetamol is not considered an overdose.

Although there is some evidence suggesting that factors such as the use of liver enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampicin, St John’s wort), chronic alcoholism, and starvation may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity, the CHM has advised that these should no longer be used in the assessment of paracetamol toxicity.

Significant toxicity is unlikely if, 24 hours or longer after the last paracetamol ingestion, the patient is asymptomatic, the plasma-paracetamol concentration is undetectable, and liver function tests, serum creatinine and INR are normal. Patients with clinical features of hepatic injury such as jaundice or hepatic tenderness should be treated urgently with acetylcysteine. If there is uncertainty about a patient’s risk of toxicity after paracetamol overdose, treatment with acetylcysteine should be commenced. Advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service whenever necessary.

Acetylcysteine dose and administration

For paracetamol overdosage, acetylcysteine is given in a total dose that is divided into 3 consecutive intravenous infusions over a total of 21 hours. The tables below include the dose of acetylcysteine, for adults and children of body-weight 40 kg and over, in terms of the volume of acetylcysteine Concentrate for Intravenous Infusion required for each of the 3 infusions. The requisite dose of acetylcysteine is added to glucose Intravenous Infusion 5%.

Paracetamol overdose treatment graph

Paracetamol overdose treatment graphAntidepressants

Tricyclic and related antidepressants

Tricyclic and related antidepressants cause dry mouth, coma of varying degree, hypotension, hypothermia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, convulsions, respiratory failure, cardiac conduction defects, and arrhythmias. Dilated pupils and urinary retention also occur. Metabolic acidosis may complicate severe poisoning; delirium with confusion, agitation, and visual and auditory hallucinations are common during recovery.

Assessment in hospital is strongly advised in case of poisoning by tricyclic and related antidepressants but symptomatic treatment can be given before transfer. Supportive measures to ensure a clear airway and adequate ventilation during transfer are mandatory. Intravenous lorazepam or intravenous diazepam (preferably in emulsion form) may be required to treat convulsions. Activated charcoal given within 1 hour of the overdose reduces absorption of the drug. Although arrhythmias are worrying, some will respond to correction of hypoxia and acidosis. The use of anti-arrhythmic drugs is best avoided, but intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate can arrest arrhythmias or prevent them in those with an extended QRS duration. Diazepam given by mouth is usually adequate to sedate delirious patients but large doses may be required.

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

Symptoms of poisoning by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors include nausea, vomiting, agitation, tremor, nystagmus, drowsiness, and sinus tachycardia; convulsions may occur. Rarely, severe poisoning results in the serotonin syndrome, with marked neuropsychiatric effects, neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic instability; hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and coagulopathies may develop.

Management of SSRI poisoning is supportive. Activated charcoal given within 1 hour of the overdose reduces absorption of the drug. Convulsions can be treated with lorazepam, diazepam, or midazolam oromucosal solution [unlicensed use in adults and children under 3 months] (see Convulsions). Contact the National Poisons Information Service for the management of hyperthermia or the serotonin syndrome.

Antimalarials

Overdosage with quinine, chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine is extremely hazardous and difficult to treat. Urgent advice from the National Poisons Information Service is essential. Life-threatening features include arrhythmias (which can have a very rapid onset) and convulsions (which can be intractable).

Antipsychotics

Phenothiazines and related drugs

Phenothiazines cause less depression of consciousness and respiration than other sedatives. Hypotension, hypothermia, sinus tachycardia, and arrhythmias may complicate poisoning. Dystonic reactions can occur with therapeutic doses (particularly with prochlorperazine and trifluoperazine), and convulsions may occur in severe cases. Arrhythmias may respond to correction of hypoxia, acidosis, and other biochemical abnormalities, but specialist advice should be sought if arrhythmias result from a prolonged QT interval; the use of some anti-arrhythmic drugs can worsen such arrhythmias. Dystonic reactions are rapidly abolished by injection of drugs such as procyclidine hydrochloride or diazepam (emulsion preferred).

Second-generation antipsychotic drugs

Features of poisoning by second-generation antipsychotic drugs include drowsiness, convulsions, extrapyramidal symptoms, hypotension, and ECG abnormalities (including prolongation of the QT interval). Management is supportive. Charcoal, activated can be given within 1 hour of ingesting a significant quantity of a second-generation antipsychotic drug.

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines taken alone cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and occasionally respiratory depression, and coma. Charcoal, activated can be given within 1 hour of ingesting a significant quantity of benzodiazepine, provided the patient is awake and the airway is protected. Benzodiazepines potentiate the effects of other central nervous system depressants taken concomitantly. Use of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil [unlicensed indication] can be hazardous, particularly in mixed overdoses involving tricyclic antidepressants or in benzodiazepine-dependent patients. Flumazenil may prevent the need for ventilation, particularly in patients with severe respiratory disorders; it should be used on expert advice only and not as a diagnostic test in patients with a reduced level of consciousness.

Beta blockers

Therapeutic overdosages with beta-blockers may cause lightheadedness, dizziness, and possibly syncope as a result of bradycardia and hypotension; heart failure may be precipitated or exacerbated. These complications are most likely in patients with conduction system disorders or impaired myocardial function. Bradycardia is the most common arrhythmia caused by beta-blockers, but sotalol may induce ventricular tachyarrhythmias (sometimes of the torsade de pointes type). The effects of massive overdosage can vary from one beta-blocker to another; propranolol overdosage in particular may cause coma and convulsions.

Acute massive overdosage must be managed in hospital and expert advice should be obtained. Maintenance of a clear airway and adequate ventilation is mandatory. An intravenous injection of atropine sulfate is required to treat bradycardia. Cardiogenic shock unresponsive to atropine sulfate is probably best treated with an intravenous injection of glucagon [unlicensed] in glucose 5% (with precautions to protect the airway in case of vomiting) followed by an intravenous infusion. If glucagon is not available, intravenous isoprenaline (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is an alternative. A cardiac pacemaker can be used to increase the heart rate.

Calcium-channel blockers

Features of calcium-channel blocker poisoning include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, agitation, confusion, and coma in severe poisoning. Metabolic acidosis and hyperglycaemia may occur. Verapamil and diltiazem have a profound cardiac depressant effect causing hypotension and arrhythmias, including complete heart block and asystole. The dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers cause severe hypotension secondary to profound peripheral vasodilatation.

Charcoal, activated should be considered if the patient presents within 1 hour of overdosage with a calcium-channel blocker; repeated doses of activated charcoal are considered if a modified-release preparation is involved. In patients with significant features of poisoning, calcium chloride or calcium gluconate is given by injection; atropine sulfate is given to correct symptomatic bradycardia. In severe cases, an insulin and glucose infusion may be required in the management of hypotension and myocardial failure. For the management of hypotension, the choice of inotropic sympathomimetic depends on whether hypotension is secondary to vasodilatation or to myocardial depression—advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.

Iron salts

Iron poisoning in childhood is usually accidental. The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, haematemesis, and rectal bleeding. Hypotension and hepatocellular necrosis can occur later. Coma, shock, and metabolic acidosis indicate severe poisoning.

Advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service if a significant quantity of iron has been ingested within the previous hour.

Mortality is reduced by intensive and specific therapy with desferrioxamine mesilate, which chelates iron. The serum-iron concentration is measured as an emergency and intravenous desferrioxamine mesilate given to chelate absorbed iron in excess of the expected iron binding capacity. In severe toxicity intravenous desferrioxamine mesilate should be given immediately without waiting for the result of the serum-iron measurement.

Lithium

Most cases of lithium intoxication occur as a complication of long-term therapy and are caused by reduced excretion of the drug because of a variety of factors including dehydration, deterioration of renal function, infections, and co-administration of diuretics or NSAIDs (or other drugs that interact). Acute deliberate overdoses may also occur with delayed onset of symptoms (12 hours or more) owing to slow entry of lithium into the tissues and continuing absorption from modified-release formulations.

The early clinical features are non-specific and may include apathy and restlessness which could be confused with mental changes arising from the patient's depressive illness. Vomiting, diarrhoea, ataxia, weakness, dysarthria, muscle twitching, and tremor may follow. Severe poisoning is associated with convulsions, coma, renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and hypotension.

Therapeutic serum-lithium concentrations are within the range of 0.4–1 mmol/litre; concentrations in excess of 2 mmol/litre are usually associated with serious toxicity and such cases may need treatment with haemodialysis if neurological symptoms or renal failure are present. In acute overdosage much higher serum-lithium concentrations may be present without features of toxicity and all that is usually necessary is to take measures to increase urine output (e.g. by increasing fluid intake but avoiding diuretics). Otherwise, treatment is supportive with special regard to electrolyte balance, renal function, and control of convulsions. Gastric lavage may be considered if it can be performed within 1 hour of ingesting significant quantities of lithium. Whole-bowel irrigation should be considered for significant ingestion, but advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service.

Amfetamines cause wakefulness, excessive activity, paranoia, hallucinations, and hypertension followed by exhaustion, convulsions, hyperthermia, and coma. The early stages can be controlled by diazepam or lorazepam; advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service on the management of hypertension. Later, tepid sponging, anticonvulsants, and artificial respiration may be needed.

Cocaine

Cocaine stimulates the central nervous system, causing agitation, dilated pupils, tachycardia, hypertension, hallucinations, hyperthermia, hypertonia, and hyperreflexia; cardiac effects include chest pain, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.

Initial treatment of cocaine poisoning involves intravenous administration of diazepam to control agitation and cooling measures for hyperthermia (see Body temperature); hypertension and cardiac effects require specific treatment and expert advice should be sought.

Ecstasy

Ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamfetamine, MDMA) may cause severe reactions, even at doses that were previously tolerated. The most serious effects are delirium, coma, convulsions, ventricular arrhythmias, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, acute hepatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, adult respiratory distress syndrome, hyperreflexia, hypotension and intracerebral haemorrhage; hyponatraemia has also been associated with ecstasy use.

Treatment of methylenedioxymethamfetamine poisoning is supportive, with diazepam to control severe agitation or persistent convulsions and close monitoring including ECG. Self-induced water intoxication should be considered in patients with ecstasy poisoning.

‘Liquid ecstasy’ is a term used for sodium oxybate (gamma-hydroxybutyrate, GHB), which is a sedative.

Theophylline

Theophylline and related drugs are often prescribed as modified-release formulations and toxicity can therefore be delayed. They cause vomiting (which may be severe and intractable), agitation, restlessness, dilated pupils, sinus tachycardia, and hyperglycaemia. More serious effects are haematemesis, convulsions, and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Severe hypokalaemia may develop rapidly.

Repeated doses of activated charcoal can be used to eliminate theophylline even if more than 1 hour has elapsed after ingestion and especially if a modified-release preparation has been taken (see also under Active Elimination Techniques). Ondansetron may be effective for severe vomiting that is resistant to other antiemetics [unlicensed indication]. Hypokalaemia is corrected by intravenous infusion of potassium chloride and may be so severe as to require 60 mmol/hour (high doses require ECG monitoring). Convulsions should be controlled by intravenous administration of lorazepam or diazepam (see Convulsions). Sedation with diazepam may be necessary in agitated patients.

Provided the patient does not suffer from asthma, a short-acting beta-blocker can be administered intravenously to reverse severe tachycardia, hypokalaemia, and hyperglycaemia.

Other poisons

Consult either the National Poisons Information Service day and night or TOXBASE, see under the National Poisons Information Service.

Cyanides

Oxygen should be administered to patients with cyanide poisoning. The choice of antidote depends on the severity of poisoning, certainty of diagnosis, and the cause. Dicobalt edetate is the antidote of choice when there is a strong clinical suspicion of severe cyanide poisoning, but it should not be used as a precautionary measure. Dicobalt edetate itself is toxic, associated with anaphylactoid reactions, and is potentially fatal if administered in the absence of cyanide poisoning. A regimen of sodium nitrite followed by sodium thiosulfate is an alternative if dicobalt edetate is not available.

Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit—no other preparation of hydroxocobalamin is suitable) can be considered for use in victims of smoke inhalation who show signs of significant cyanide poisoning.

Ethylene glycol and methanol

Fomepizole (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is the treatment of choice for ethylene glycol and methanol (methyl alcohol) poisoning. If necessary, ethanol (by mouth or by intravenous infusion) can be used, but with caution. Advice on the treatment of ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning should be obtained from the National Poisons Information Service. It is important to start antidote treatment promptly in cases of suspected poisoning with these agents.

Heavy metals

Heavy metal antidotes include succimer (DMSA) [unlicensed], unithiol (DMPS) [unlicensed], sodium calcium edetate [unlicensed], and dimercaprol. Dimercaprol in the management of heavy metal poisoning has been superseded by other chelating agents. In all cases of heavy metal poisoning, the advice of the National Poisons Information Service should be sought.

Noxious gases

Carbon monoxide

Carbon monoxide poisoning is usually due to inhalation of smoke, car exhaust, or fumes caused by blocked flues or incomplete combustion of fuel gases in confined spaces.

Immediate treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning is essential. The person should be moved to fresh air, the airway cleared, and high-flow oxygen 100% administered through a tight-fitting mask with an inflated face seal. Artificial respiration should be given as necessary and continued until adequate spontaneous breathing starts, or stopped only after persistent and efficient treatment of cardiac arrest has failed. The patient should be admitted to hospital because complications may arise after a delay of hours or days. Cerebral oedema may occur in severe poisoning and is treated with an intravenous infusion of mannitol. Referral for hyperbaric oxygen treatment should be discussed with the National Poisons Information Service if the patient is pregnant or in cases of severe poisoning, such as if the patient is or has been unconscious, or has psychiatric or neurological features other than a headache, or has myocardial ischaemia or an arrhythmia, or has a blood carboxyhaemoglobin concentration of more than 20%.

Sulfur dioxide, chlorine, phosgene, ammonia

All of these gases can cause upper respiratory tract and conjunctival irritation. Pulmonary oedema, with severe breathlessness and cyanosis may develop suddenly up to 36 hours after exposure. Death may occur. Patients are kept under observation and those who develop pulmonary oedema are given oxygen. Assisted ventilation may be necessary in the most serious cases.

CS Spray

CS spray, which is used for riot control, irritates the eyes (hence ‘tear gas’) and the respiratory tract; symptoms normally settle spontaneously within 15 minutes. If symptoms persist, the patient should be removed to a well-ventilated area, and the exposed skin washed with soap and water after removal of contaminated clothing. Contact lenses should be removed and rigid ones washed (soft ones should be discarded). Eye symptoms should be treated by irrigating the eyes with physiological saline (or water if saline is not available) and advice sought from an ophthalmologist. Patients with features of severe poisoning, particularly respiratory complications, should be admitted to hospital for symptomatic treatment.

Nerve agents

Treatment of nerve agent poisoning is similar to organophosphorus insecticide poisoning, but advice must be sought from the National Poisons Information Service. The risk of cross-contamination is significant; adequate decontamination and protective clothing for healthcare personnel are essential. In emergencies involving the release of nerve agents, kits (‘NAAS pods’) containing pralidoxime chloride can be obtained through the Ambulance Service from the National Blood Service (or the Welsh Blood Service in South Wales or designated hospital pharmacies in Northern Ireland and Scotland—see TOXBASE for list of designated centres).

Pesticides

Organophosphorus insecticides

Organophosphorus insecticides are usually supplied as powders or dissolved in organic solvents. All are absorbed through the bronchi and intact skin as well as through the gut and inhibit cholinesterase activity, thereby prolonging and intensifying the effects of acetylcholine. Toxicity between different compounds varies considerably, and onset may be delayed after skin exposure.

Anxiety, restlessness, dizziness, headache, miosis, nausea, hypersalivation, vomiting, abdominal colic, diarrhoea, bradycardia, and sweating are common features of organophosphorus poisoning. Muscle weakness and fasciculation may develop and progress to generalised flaccid paralysis, including the ocular and respiratory muscles. Convulsions, coma, pulmonary oedema with copious bronchial secretions, hypoxia, and arrhythmias occur in severe cases. Hyperglycaemia and glycosuria without ketonuria may also be present.

Further absorption of the organophosphorus insecticide should be prevented by moving the patient to fresh air, removing soiled clothing, and washing contaminated skin. In severe poisoning it is vital to ensure a clear airway, frequent removal of bronchial secretions, and adequate ventilation and oxygenation; gastric lavage may be considered provided that the airway is protected. Atropine sulfate will reverse the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine and is given by intravenous injection until the skin becomes flushed and dry, the pupils dilate, and bradycardia is abolished.

Pralidoxime chloride, a cholinesterase reactivator, is used as an adjunct to atropine sulfate in moderate or severe poisoning. It improves muscle tone within 30 minutes of administration. Pralidoxime chloride is continued until the patient has not required atropine sulfate for 12 hours. Pralidoxime chloride can be obtained from designated centres, the names of which are held by the National Poisons Information Service.

Snake bites and animal stings

Snake bites

Envenoming from snake bite is uncommon in the UK. Many exotic snakes are kept, some illegally, but the only indigenous venomous snake is the adder (Vipera berus). The bite may cause local and systemic effects. Local effects include pain, swelling, bruising, and tender enlargement of regional lymph nodes. Systemic effects include early anaphylactic symptoms (transient hypotension with syncope, angioedema, urticaria, abdominal colic, diarrhoea, and vomiting), with later persistent or recurrent hypotension, ECG abnormalities, spontaneous systemic bleeding, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and acute renal failure. Fatal envenoming is rare but the potential for severe envenoming must not be underestimated.

Early anaphylactic symptoms should be treated with adrenaline/epinephrine . Indications for european viper snake venom antiserum treatment include systemic envenoming, especially hypotension, ECG abnormalities, vomiting, haemostatic abnormalities, and marked local envenoming such that after bites on the hand or foot, swelling extends beyond the wrist or ankle within 4 hours of the bite. For those patients who present with clinical features of severe envenoming (e.g. shock, ECG abnormalities, or local swelling that has advanced from the foot to above the knee or from the hand to above the elbow within 2 hours of the bite), a higher initial dose of the european viper snake venom antiserum is recommended; if symptoms of systemic envenoming persist contact the National Poisons Information Service. Adrenaline/epinephrine injection must be immediately to hand for treatment of anaphylactic reactions to the european viper snake venom antiserum.

European viper snake venom antiserum is available for bites by certain foreign snakes and spiders, stings by scorpions and fish. For information on identification, management, and for supply in an emergency, telephone the National Poisons Information Service. Whenever possible the TOXBASE entry should be read, and relevant information collected, before telephoning the National Poisons Information Service.

Insect stings

Stings from ants, wasps, hornets, and bees cause local pain and swelling but seldom cause severe direct toxicity unless many stings are inflicted at the same time. If the sting is in the mouth or on the tongue local swelling may threaten the upper airway. The stings from these insects are usually treated by cleaning the area with a topical antiseptic. Bee stings should be removed as quickly as possible. Anaphylactic reactions require immediate treatment with intramuscular adrenaline/epinephrine; self-administered intramuscular adrenaline/epinephrine (e.g. EpiPen) is the best first-aid treatment for patients with severe hypersensitivity. An inhaled bronchodilator should be used for asthmatic reactions, see also the management of anaphylaxis. A short course of an oral antihistamine or a topical corticosteroid may help to reduce inflammation and relieve itching. A vaccine containing extracts of bee and wasp venom can be used to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis and systemic reactions in patients with systemic hypersensitivity to bee or wasp stings.

Marine stings

The severe pain of weeverfish (Trachinus vipera) and Portuguese man-o’-war stings can be relieved by immersing the stung area immediately in uncomfortably hot, but not scalding, water (not more than 45° C). People stung by jellyfish and Portuguese man-o’-war around the UK coast should be removed from the sea as soon as possible. Adherent tentacles should be lifted off carefully (wearing gloves or using tweezers) or washed off with seawater. Alcoholic solutions, including suntan lotions, should not be applied because they can cause further discharge of stinging hairs. Ice packs can be used to reduce pain.

Emollients soothe, smooth and hydrate the skin and are indicated for all dry or scaling disorders. Their effects are short lived and they should be applied frequently even after improvement occurs. They are useful in dry and eczematous disorders, and to a lesser extent in psoriasis. The choice of an appropriate emollient will depend on the severity of the condition, patient preference, and the site of application.

Emollient bath and shower preparations

Emollient bath additives should be added to bath water; hydration can be improved by soaking in the bath for 10–20 minutes. Some bath emollients can be applied to wet skin undiluted and rinsed off. In dry skin conditions soap should be avoided.

The quantities of bath additives recommended for adults are suitable for an adult-size bath. Proportionately less should be used for a child-size bath or a washbasin; recommended bath additive quantities for children reflect this.

Barrier preparations often contain water-repellent substances such as dimeticone or other silicones.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Control of the epilepsies</p>
    <p>The object of treatment is to prevent the occurrence of seizures by maintaining an effective dose of one or more antiepileptic drugs. Careful adjustment of doses is necessary, starting with low doses and increasing gradually until seizures are controlled or there are significant adverse effects.</p>
    <p>When choosing an antiepileptic drug, the presenting epilepsy syndrome should first be considered. If the syndrome is not clear, the seizure type should determine the choice of treatment. Concomitant medication, co-morbidity, age, and sex should also be taken into account.</p>
    <p>The dosage frequency is often determined by the plasma-drug half-life, and should be kept as low as possible to encourage adherence with the prescribed regimen. Most antiepileptics, when used in the usual dosage, can be given twice daily. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/lamotrigine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2939\">Lamotrigine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/perampanel.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP18940\">perampanel</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/phenobarbital.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2950\">phenobarbital</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/phenytoin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2958\">phenytoin</xref>, which have long half-lives, can be given once daily at bedtime. However, with large doses, some antiepileptics may need to be given more frequently to avoid adverse effects associated with high peak plasma-drug concentration.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management</p>
      <p>When monotherapy with a first-line antiepileptic drug has failed, monotherapy with a second drug should be tried; the diagnosis should be checked before starting an alternative drug if the first drug showed lack of efficacy. The change from one antiepileptic drug to another should be cautious, slowly withdrawing the first drug only when the new regimen has been established. Combination therapy with two or more antiepileptic drugs may be necessary, but the concurrent use of antiepileptic drugs increases the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions. If combination therapy does not bring about worthwhile benefits, revert to the regimen (monotherapy or combination therapy) that provided the best balance between tolerability and efficacy. A single antiepileptic drug should be prescribed wherever possible.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">MHRA/CHM advice: Antiepileptic drugs: new advice on switching between different manufacturers’ products for a particular drug (November 2013)</p>
      <p>The CHM has reviewed spontaneous adverse reactions received by the MHRA and publications that reported potential harm arising from switching of antiepileptic drugs in patients previously stabilised on a branded product to a generic. The CHM concluded that reports of loss of seizure control and/or worsening of side-effects around the time of switching between products could be explained as chance associations, but that a causal role of switching could not be ruled out in all cases. The following guidance has been issued to help minimise risk:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Different antiepileptic drugs vary considerably in their characteristics, which influences the risk of whether switching between different manufacturers’ products of a particular drug may cause adverse effects or loss of seizure control;</li>
        <li>Antiepileptic drugs have been divided into three risk-based categories to help healthcare professionals decide whether it is necessary to maintain continuity of supply of a specific manufacturer’s product. These categories are listed below;</li>
        <li>If it is felt desirable for a patient to be maintained on a specific manufacturer’s product this should be prescribed either by specifying a brand name, or by using the generic drug name and name of the manufacturer (otherwise known as the Marketing Authorisation Holder);</li>
        <li>This advice relates only to antiepileptic drug use for treatment of epilepsy; it does not apply to their use in other indications (e.g. mood stabilisation, neuropathic pain);</li>
        <li>Please report on a Yellow Card any suspected adverse reactions to antiepileptic drugs;</li>
        <li>Dispensing pharmacists should ensure the continuity of supply of a particular product when the prescription specifies it. If the prescribed product is unavailable, it may be necessary to dispense a product from a different manufacturer to maintain continuity of treatment of that antiepileptic drug. Such cases should be discussed and agreed with both the prescriber and patient (or carer);</li>
        <li>Usual dispensing practice can be followed when a specific product is not stated.</li>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome</p>
      <p>Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal syndrome associated with some antiepileptic drugs (<b>carbamazepine</b>, <b>lacosamide</b>, <b>lamotrigine</b>, <b>oxcarbazepine</b>, <b>phenobarbital</b>, <b>phenytoin</b>, <b>primidone</b>, and <b>rufinamide</b>); rarely cross-sensitivity occurs between some of these antiepileptic drugs. Some other antiepileptics (<b>eslicarbazepine</b>, <b>stiripentol</b>, and <b>zonisamide</b>) have a theoretical risk. The symptoms usually start between 1 and 8 weeks of exposure; fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy are most commonly seen. Other systemic signs include liver dysfunction, haematological, renal, and pulmonary abnormalities, vasculitis, and multi-organ failure. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity syndrome occur, the drug should be withdrawn immediately, the patient must not be re-exposed, and expert advice should be sought.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Interactions</p>
      <p>Interactions between antiepileptics are complex and may increase toxicity without a corresponding increase in antiepileptic effect. Interactions are usually caused by hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition; displacement from protein binding sites is not usually a problem. These interactions are highly variable and unpredictable.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Withdrawal</p>
      <p>Antiepileptic drugs should be withdrawn under specialist supervision. Avoid abrupt withdrawal, particularly of barbiturates and benzodiazepines, because this can precipitate severe rebound seizures. Reduction in dosage should be gradual and, in the case of barbiturates, withdrawal of the drug may take months.</p>
      <p>The decision to withdraw antiepileptic drugs from a seizure-free patient, and its timing, is often difficult and depends on individual circumstances. Even in patients who have been seizure-free for several years, there is a significant risk of seizure recurrence on drug withdrawal. In patients receiving several antiepileptic drugs, only one drug should be withdrawn at a time.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Driving</p>
      <p>Patients with epilepsy may drive a motor vehicle (but not a large goods or passenger carrying vehicle) provided that they have been seizure-free for one year or, if subject to attacks only while asleep, have established a 3-year period of asleep attacks without awake attacks. Those affected by drowsiness should not drive or operate machinery.</p>
      <p>Guidance issued by the Drivers Medical Unit of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) recommends that patients should be advised not to drive during medication changes or withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs, and for 6 months afterwards.</p>
      <p>Patients who have had a first or single epileptic seizure must not drive for 6 months (5 years in the case of large goods or passenger carrying vehicles) after the event; driving may then be resumed, provided the patient has been assessed by a specialist as fit to drive because no abnormality was detected on investigation.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Pregnancy</p>
      <p>Women of child-bearing potential should discuss with a specialist the impact of both epilepsy, and its treatment, on the outcome of pregnancy.</p>
      <p>There is an increased risk of teratogenicity associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs (especially if used during the first trimester and particularly if the patient takes two or more antiepileptic drugs). Valproate is associated with the highest risk of major and minor congenital malformations (in particular neural tube defects), and long-term neurodevelopmental effects. There is also an increased risk of teratogenicity with phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine. Topiramate carries an increased risk of cleft palate if taken in the first trimester of pregnancy. There is not enough evidence to establish the risk of teratogenicity with other antiepileptic drugs.</p>
      <p>Prescribers should also consider carefully the choice of antiepileptic therapy in pre-pubescent girls who may later become pregnant. Women of child-bearing potential who take antiepileptic drugs should be given contraceptive advice. Some antiepileptic drugs can reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives, and the efficacy of some antiepileptics may be affected by hormonal contraceptives.</p>
      <p>Women who want to become pregnant should be referred to a specialist for advice in advance of conception. For some women, the severity of seizure or the seizure type may not pose a serious threat, and drug withdrawal may be considered; therapy may be resumed after the first trimester. If treatment with antiepileptic drugs must continue throughout pregnancy, then monotherapy is preferable at the lowest effective dose.</p>
      <p>Once an unplanned pregnancy is discovered it is usually too late for changes to be made to the treatment regimen; the risk of harm to the mother and fetus from convulsive seizures outweighs the risk of continued therapy. The likelihood of a woman who is taking antiepileptic drugs having a baby with no malformations is at least 90%, and it is important that women do not stop taking essential treatment because of concern over harm to the fetus. To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, folate supplementation is advised before conception and throughout the first trimester.</p>
      <p>The concentration of antiepileptic drugs in the plasma can change during pregnancy. Doses of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine should be adjusted on the basis of plasma-drug concentration monitoring; the dose of other antiepileptic drugs should be monitored carefully during pregnancy and after birth, and adjustments made on a clinical basis. Plasma-drug concentration monitoring during pregnancy is also useful to check compliance. Additionally, in patients taking topiramate or levetiracetam, it is recommended that fetal growth should be monitored. Women who have seizures in the second half of pregnancy should be assessed for eclampsia before any change is made to antiepileptic treatment. Status epilepticus should be treated according to the standard protocol.</p>
      <p>Routine injection of vitamin K at birth minimises the risk of neonatal haemorrhage associated with antiepileptics. Withdrawal effects in the newborn may occur with some antiepileptic drugs, in particular benzodiazepines and phenobarbital.</p>

        <p outputclass=\"title\">Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register</p>
        <p>All pregnant women with epilepsy, whether taking medication or not, should be encouraged to notify the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (Tel: 0800 389 1248).</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Breast-feeding</p>
      <p>Women taking antiepileptic monotherapy should generally be encouraged to breast-feed; if a woman is on combination therapy or if there are other risk factors, such as premature birth, specialist advice should be sought.</p>
      <p>All infants should be monitored for sedation, feeding difficulties, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones. Infants should also be monitored for adverse effects associated with the antiepileptic drug particularly with newer antiepileptics, if the antiepileptic is readily transferred into breast-milk causing high infant serum-drug concentrations (e.g. ethosuximide, lamotrigine, primidone, and zonisamide), or if slower metabolism in the infant causes drugs to accumulate (e.g. phenobarbital and lamotrigine). Serum-drug concentration monitoring should be undertaken in breast-fed infants if suspected adverse reactions develop; if toxicity develops it may be necessary to introduce formula feeds to limit the infant's drug exposure, or to wean the infant off breast-milk altogether.</p>
      <p>Primidone, phenobarbital, and the benzodiazepines are associated with an established risk of drowsiness in breast-fed babies and caution is required.</p>
      <p>Withdrawal effects may occur in infants if a mother suddenly stops breast-feeding, particularly if she is taking phenobarbital, primidone, or lamotrigine.</p>

The object of treatment is to prevent the occurrence of seizures by maintaining an effective dose of one or more antiepileptic drugs. Careful adjustment of doses is necessary, starting with low doses and increasing gradually until seizures are controlled or there are significant adverse effects.

When choosing an antiepileptic drug, the presenting epilepsy syndrome should first be considered. If the syndrome is not clear, the seizure type should determine the choice of treatment. Concomitant medication, co-morbidity, age, and sex should also be taken into account.

The dosage frequency is often determined by the plasma-drug half-life, and should be kept as low as possible to encourage adherence with the prescribed regimen. Most antiepileptics, when used in the usual dosage, can be given twice daily. Lamotrigine, perampanel, phenobarbital, and phenytoin, which have long half-lives, can be given once daily at bedtime. However, with large doses, some antiepileptics may need to be given more frequently to avoid adverse effects associated with high peak plasma-drug concentration.

Management

When monotherapy with a first-line antiepileptic drug has failed, monotherapy with a second drug should be tried; the diagnosis should be checked before starting an alternative drug if the first drug showed lack of efficacy. The change from one antiepileptic drug to another should be cautious, slowly withdrawing the first drug only when the new regimen has been established. Combination therapy with two or more antiepileptic drugs may be necessary, but the concurrent use of antiepileptic drugs increases the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions. If combination therapy does not bring about worthwhile benefits, revert to the regimen (monotherapy or combination therapy) that provided the best balance between tolerability and efficacy. A single antiepileptic drug should be prescribed wherever possible.

MHRA/CHM advice: Antiepileptic drugs: new advice on switching between different manufacturers’ products for a particular drug (November 2013)

The CHM has reviewed spontaneous adverse reactions received by the MHRA and publications that reported potential harm arising from switching of antiepileptic drugs in patients previously stabilised on a branded product to a generic. The CHM concluded that reports of loss of seizure control and/or worsening of side-effects around the time of switching between products could be explained as chance associations, but that a causal role of switching could not be ruled out in all cases. The following guidance has been issued to help minimise risk:

 Different antiepileptic drugs vary considerably in their characteristics, which influences the risk of whether switching between different manufacturers’ products of a particular drug may cause adverse effects or loss of seizure control;Antiepileptic drugs have been divided into three risk-based categories to help healthcare professionals decide whether it is necessary to maintain continuity of supply of a specific manufacturer’s product. These categories are listed below;If it is felt desirable for a patient to be maintained on a specific manufacturer’s product this should be prescribed either by specifying a brand name, or by using the generic drug name and name of the manufacturer (otherwise known as the Marketing Authorisation Holder);This advice relates only to antiepileptic drug use for treatment of epilepsy; it does not apply to their use in other indications (e.g. mood stabilisation, neuropathic pain);Please report on a Yellow Card any suspected adverse reactions to antiepileptic drugs;Dispensing pharmacists should ensure the continuity of supply of a particular product when the prescription specifies it. If the prescribed product is unavailable, it may be necessary to dispense a product from a different manufacturer to maintain continuity of treatment of that antiepileptic drug. Such cases should be discussed and agreed with both the prescriber and patient (or carer);Usual dispensing practice can be followed when a specific product is not stated.Category 1

phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone. For these drugs, doctors are advised to ensure that their patient is maintained on a specific manufacturer’s product.

Category 2

Valproate, lamotrigine, perampanel, retigabine, rufinamide, clobazam, clonazepam, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, zonisamide, topiramate. For these drugs, the need for continued supply of a particular manufacturer's product should be based on clinical judgement and consultation with the patient and/or carer taking into account factors such as seizure frequency and treatment history.

Category 3

levetiracetam, lacosamide, tiagabine, gabapentin,pregabalin, ethosuximide, vigabatrin. For these drugs, it is usually unnecessary to ensure that patients are maintained on a specific manufacturer’s product unless there are specific concerns such as patient anxiety, and risk of confusion or dosing errors Interactions.

Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome

Antiepileptic hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal syndrome associated with some antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, lacosamide, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and rufinamide); rarely cross-sensitivity occurs between some of these antiepileptic drugs. Some other antiepileptics (eslicarbazepine, stiripentol, and zonisamide) have a theoretical risk. The symptoms usually start between 1 and 8 weeks of exposure; fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy are most commonly seen. Other systemic signs include liver dysfunction, haematological, renal, and pulmonary abnormalities, vasculitis, and multi-organ failure. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity syndrome occur, the drug should be withdrawn immediately, the patient must not be re-exposed, and expert advice should be sought.

Interactions

Interactions between antiepileptics are complex and may increase toxicity without a corresponding increase in antiepileptic effect. Interactions are usually caused by hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition; displacement from protein binding sites is not usually a problem. These interactions are highly variable and unpredictable.

Withdrawal

Antiepileptic drugs should be withdrawn under specialist supervision. Avoid abrupt withdrawal, particularly of barbiturates and benzodiazepines, because this can precipitate severe rebound seizures. Reduction in dosage should be gradual and, in the case of barbiturates, withdrawal of the drug may take months.

The decision to withdraw antiepileptic drugs from a seizure-free patient, and its timing, is often difficult and depends on individual circumstances. Even in patients who have been seizure-free for several years, there is a significant risk of seizure recurrence on drug withdrawal. In patients receiving several antiepileptic drugs, only one drug should be withdrawn at a time.

Driving

Patients with epilepsy may drive a motor vehicle (but not a large goods or passenger carrying vehicle) provided that they have been seizure-free for one year or, if subject to attacks only while asleep, have established a 3-year period of asleep attacks without awake attacks. Those affected by drowsiness should not drive or operate machinery.

Guidance issued by the Drivers Medical Unit of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) recommends that patients should be advised not to drive during medication changes or withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs, and for 6 months afterwards.

Patients who have had a first or single epileptic seizure must not drive for 6 months (5 years in the case of large goods or passenger carrying vehicles) after the event; driving may then be resumed, provided the patient has been assessed by a specialist as fit to drive because no abnormality was detected on investigation.

Pregnancy

Women of child-bearing potential should discuss with a specialist the impact of both epilepsy, and its treatment, on the outcome of pregnancy.

There is an increased risk of teratogenicity associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs (especially if used during the first trimester and particularly if the patient takes two or more antiepileptic drugs). Valproate is associated with the highest risk of major and minor congenital malformations (in particular neural tube defects), and long-term neurodevelopmental effects. There is also an increased risk of teratogenicity with phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine. Topiramate carries an increased risk of cleft palate if taken in the first trimester of pregnancy. There is not enough evidence to establish the risk of teratogenicity with other antiepileptic drugs.

Prescribers should also consider carefully the choice of antiepileptic therapy in pre-pubescent girls who may later become pregnant. Women of child-bearing potential who take antiepileptic drugs should be given contraceptive advice. Some antiepileptic drugs can reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives, and the efficacy of some antiepileptics may be affected by hormonal contraceptives.

Women who want to become pregnant should be referred to a specialist for advice in advance of conception. For some women, the severity of seizure or the seizure type may not pose a serious threat, and drug withdrawal may be considered; therapy may be resumed after the first trimester. If treatment with antiepileptic drugs must continue throughout pregnancy, then monotherapy is preferable at the lowest effective dose.

Once an unplanned pregnancy is discovered it is usually too late for changes to be made to the treatment regimen; the risk of harm to the mother and fetus from convulsive seizures outweighs the risk of continued therapy. The likelihood of a woman who is taking antiepileptic drugs having a baby with no malformations is at least 90%, and it is important that women do not stop taking essential treatment because of concern over harm to the fetus. To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, folate supplementation is advised before conception and throughout the first trimester.

The concentration of antiepileptic drugs in the plasma can change during pregnancy. Doses of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine should be adjusted on the basis of plasma-drug concentration monitoring; the dose of other antiepileptic drugs should be monitored carefully during pregnancy and after birth, and adjustments made on a clinical basis. Plasma-drug concentration monitoring during pregnancy is also useful to check compliance. Additionally, in patients taking topiramate or levetiracetam, it is recommended that fetal growth should be monitored. Women who have seizures in the second half of pregnancy should be assessed for eclampsia before any change is made to antiepileptic treatment. Status epilepticus should be treated according to the standard protocol.

Routine injection of vitamin K at birth minimises the risk of neonatal haemorrhage associated with antiepileptics. Withdrawal effects in the newborn may occur with some antiepileptic drugs, in particular benzodiazepines and phenobarbital.

Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register

All pregnant women with epilepsy, whether taking medication or not, should be encouraged to notify the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (Tel: 0800 389 1248).

Breast-feeding

Women taking antiepileptic monotherapy should generally be encouraged to breast-feed; if a woman is on combination therapy or if there are other risk factors, such as premature birth, specialist advice should be sought.

All infants should be monitored for sedation, feeding difficulties, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones. Infants should also be monitored for adverse effects associated with the antiepileptic drug particularly with newer antiepileptics, if the antiepileptic is readily transferred into breast-milk causing high infant serum-drug concentrations (e.g. ethosuximide, lamotrigine, primidone, and zonisamide), or if slower metabolism in the infant causes drugs to accumulate (e.g. phenobarbital and lamotrigine). Serum-drug concentration monitoring should be undertaken in breast-fed infants if suspected adverse reactions develop; if toxicity develops it may be necessary to introduce formula feeds to limit the infant's drug exposure, or to wean the infant off breast-milk altogether.

Primidone, phenobarbital, and the benzodiazepines are associated with an established risk of drowsiness in breast-fed babies and caution is required.

Withdrawal effects may occur in infants if a mother suddenly stops breast-feeding, particularly if she is taking phenobarbital, primidone, or lamotrigine.

Focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation

Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are first-line options for treating newly diagnosed focal seizures; oxcarbazepine, sodium valproate and levetiracetam may be used if carbamazepine or lamotrigine are unsuitable or not tolerated. If monotherapy is unsuccessful with two of these first-line antiepileptic drugs, adjunctive treatment may be considered. Options for adjunctive treatment include carbamazepine, clobazam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, sodium valproate, or topiramate. If adjunctive treatment is ineffective or not tolerated, a tertiary epilepsy specialist should be consulted who may consider eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pregabalin, tiagabine, vigabatrin and zonisamide.

Generalised seizures

Tonic-clonic seizures

Sodium valproate is the first-line treatment for newly diagnosed generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Lamotrigine is the alternative choice if sodium valproate is not suitable, but may exacerbate myoclonic seizures. In those with established epilepsy with generalised tonic-clonic seizures only, lamotrigine or sodium valproate may be prescribed as the first-line treatment. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine may also be considered in newly diagnosed and established tonic-clonic seizures, but may exacerbate myoclonic and absence seizures. Clobazam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, sodium valproate or topiramate may be used as adjunctive treatment if monotherapy is ineffective or not tolerated.

Absence seizures

Ethosuximide or sodium valproate are the drugs of choice in absence seizures and syndromes; lamotrigine is a suitable alternative when ethosuximide and sodium valproate are unsuitable, ineffective or not tolerated. Sodium valproate should be used as the first choice if there is a high risk of generalised tonic-clonic seizures. A combination of any two of these drugs may be used if monotherapy is ineffective. Clobazam, clonazepam, levetiracetam, topiramate or zonisamide may be considered by a tertiary epilepsy specialist if adjunctive treatment fails. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, pregabalin, tiagabine and vigabatrin are not recommended in absence seizures or syndromes.

Myoclonic seizures

Myoclonic seizures (myoclonic jerks) occur in a variety of syndromes, and response to treatment varies considerably. Sodium valproate is the drug of choice in newly diagnosed myoclonic seizures; topiramate and levetiracetam are alternative options if sodium valproate is unsuitable but consideration should be given to the less favourable side-effect profile of topiramate. A combination of two of these drugs may be used if monotherapy is ineffective or not tolerated. If adjunctive treatment fails, a tertiary epilepsy specialist should be consulted and may consider clobazam, clonazepam, zonisamide or piracetam. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, pregabalin, tiagabine and vigabatrin are not recommended for the treatment of myoclonic seizures.

Sodium valproate and levetiracetam are effective in treating the generalised tonic-clonic seizures that coexist with myoclonic seizures in idiopathic generalised epilepsy.

Atonic and tonic seizures

Atonic and tonic seizures are usually seen in childhood, in specific epilepsy syndromes, or associated with cerebral damage or mental retardation. They may respond poorly to the traditional drugs. Sodium valproate is the drug of choice; lamotrigine can be added as adjunctive treatment. If adjunctive treatment is ineffective or not tolerated, a tertiary epilepsy specialist should be consulted, and may consider rufinamide or topiramate. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, tiagabine or vigabatrin are not recommended in atonic and tonic seizures.

Epilepsy syndromes

Some drugs are licensed for use in particular epilepsy syndromes, such as lamotrigine and rufinamide in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The epilepsy syndromes are specific types of epilepsy that are characterised according to a number of features including seizure type, age of onset, and EEG characteristics.

Antiepileptic drugs

Carbamazepine and related antiepileptics

Carbamazepine is a drug of choice for simple and complex focal seizures and is a first-line treatment option for generalised tonic-clonic seizures. It can be used as adjunctive treatment for focal seizures when monotherapy has been ineffective. It is essential to initiate carbamazepine therapy at a low dose and build this up slowly. Carbamazepine may exacerbate tonic, atonic, myoclonic and absence seizures and is therefore not recommended if these seizures are present.

Oxcarbazepine is licensed as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for the treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. It can also be considered for the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures [unlicensed]. Oxcarbazepine is not recommended in tonic, atonic, absence or myoclonic seizures due to the risk of seizure exacerbation.

Eslicarbazepine acetate is licensed for adjunctive treatment in adults with focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation.

Ethosuximide

Ethosuximide is a first-line treatment option for absence seizures. It may also be prescribed as adjunctive treatment for absence seizures when monotherapy is ineffective. Ethosuximide is also licensed for myoclonic seizures.

Gabapentin and pregabalin

Gabapentin and pregabalin are used for the treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation. They are not recommended if tonic, atonic, absence or myoclonic seizures are present. Both are also licensed for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Pregabalin is licensed for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Gabapentin is an effective treatment for migraine prophylaxis [unlicensed].

Lamotrigine

Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug recommended as a first-line treatment for focal seizures and primary and secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. It is also licensed for typical absence seizures in children (but efficacy may not be maintained in all children) and is an unlicensed treatment option in adults if first-line treatments have been unsuccessful. Lamotrigine can also be used as adjunctive treatment in atonic or tonic seizures if first-line treatment has failed [unlicensed]. Myoclonic seizures may be exacerbated by lamotrigine and it can cause serious rashes especially in children; dose recommendations should be adhered to closely.

Lamotrigine is used either as sole treatment or as an adjunct to treatment with other antiepileptic drugs. Valproate increases plasma-lamotrigine concentration, whereas the enzyme-inducing antiepileptics reduce it; care is therefore required in choosing the appropriate initial dose and subsequent titration. When the potential for interaction is not known, treatment should be initiated with lower doses, such as those used with valproate.

Levetiracetam

Levetiracetam is used for monotherapy and adjunctive treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation, and for adjunctive treatment of myoclonic seizures in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Levetiracetam may be prescribed alone and in combination for the treatment of myoclonic seizures, and under specialist supervision for absence seizures [both unlicensed].

Phenobarbital and primidone

Phenobarbital is effective for tonic-clonic and focal seizures but may be sedative in adults. It may be tried for atypical absence, atonic, and tonic seizures. Rebound seizures may be a problem on withdrawal.

Primidone is largely converted to phenobarbital and this is probably responsible for its antiepileptic action. A low initial dose of primidone is essential.

Phenytoin

Phenytoin is licensed for tonic-clonic and focal seizures but may exacerbate absence or myoclonic seizures and should be avoided if these seizures are present. It has a narrow therapeutic index and the relationship between dose and plasma-drug concentration is non-linear; small dosage increases in some patients may produce large increases in plasma concentration with acute toxic side-effects. Similarly, a few missed doses or a small change in drug absorption may result in a marked change in plasma-drug concentration. Monitoring of plasma-drug concentration improves dosage adjustment.

When only parenteral administration is possible, fosphenytoin sodium, a pro-drug of phenytoin, may be convenient to give. Unlike phenytoin (which should only be given intravenously), fosphenytoin sodium may also be given by intramuscular injection.

Rufinamide

Rufinamide is licensed for the adjunctive treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It may be considered by a tertiary specialist for the treatment of refractory tonic or atonic seizures [unlicensed].

Topiramate

Topiramate can be given alone or as adjunctive treatment in generalised tonic-clonic seizures or focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation. It can be used as adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and for absence, tonic and atonic seizures under specialist supervision [unlicensed]. It can also be considered as an option in myoclonic seizures [unlicensed]. Topiramate is also licensed for prophylaxis of migraine.

Valproate

Sodium valproate is effective in controlling tonic-clonic seizures, particularly in primary generalised epilepsy. It is a drug of choice in primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, focal seizures, generalised absences and myoclonic seizures, and can be tried in atypical absence seizures. It is recommended as a first-line option in atonic and tonic seizures. Sodium valproate has widespread metabolic effects and monitoring of liver function tests and full blood count is essential.

Valproic acid (as semisodium valproate) is licensed for acute mania associated with bipolar disorder.

Zonisamide

Zonisamide can be used alone for the treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy, and as adjunctive treatment for refractory focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and children aged 6 years and above. It can also be used under the supervision of a specialist for refractory absence and myoclonic seizures [unlicensed indications].

Benzodiazepines

Clobazam may be used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of generalised tonic-clonic and refractory focal seizures. It may be prescribed under the care of a specialist for refractory absence and myoclonic seizures. Clonazepam may be prescribed by a specialist for refractory absence and myoclonic seizures, but its sedative side-effects may be prominent.

Other drugs

Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has a specific role in treating epilepsy associated with menstruation. Piracetam is used as adjunctive treatment for cortical myoclonus.

Status epilepticus

Convulsive status epilepticus

Immediate measures to manage status epilepticus include positioning the patient to avoid injury, supporting respiration including the provision of oxygen, maintaining blood pressure, and the correction of any hypoglycaemia. Parenteral thiamine should be considered if alcohol abuse is suspected; pyridoxine hydrochloride should be given if the status epilepticus is caused by pyridoxine hydrochloride deficiency.

Seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes should be treated urgently with intravenous lorazepam (repeated once after 10 minutes if seizures recur or fail to respond). Intravenous diazepam is effective but it carries a high risk of thrombophlebitis (reduced by using an emulsion formulation). Absorption of diazepam from intramuscular injection or from suppositories is too slow for treatment of status epilepticus. Patients should be monitored for respiratory depression and hypotension.

Where facilities for resuscitation are not immediately available, diazepam can be administered as a rectal solution or midazolam oromucosal solution can be given into the buccal cavity.

Important

If, after initial treatment with benzodiazepines, seizures recur or fail to respond 25 minutes after onset, phenytoin sodium, fosphenytoin sodium, or phenobarbital sodium should be used; contact intensive care unit if seizures continue. If these measures fail to control seizures 45 minutes after onset, anaesthesia with thiopental sodium, midazolam, or a non-barbiturate anaesthetic such as propofol [unlicensed indication], should be instituted with full intensive care support.

Phenytoin sodium can be given by slow intravenous injection, followed by the maintenance dosage if appropriate.

Alternatively, fosphenytoin sodium (a pro-drug of phenytoin), can be given more rapidly and when given intravenously causes fewer injection-site reactions than phenytoin sodium. Although it can also be given intramuscularly, absorption is too slow by this route for treatment of status epilepticus. Doses of fosphenytoin sodium should be expressed in terms of phenytoin sodium.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus

The urgency to treat non-convulsive status epilepticus depends on the severity of the patient’s condition. If there is incomplete loss of awareness, usual oral antiepileptic therapy should be continued or restarted. Patients who fail to respond to oral antiepileptic therapy or have complete lack of awareness can be treated in the same way as for convulsive status epilepticus, although anaesthesia is rarely needed.

Febrile convulsions

Brief febrile convulsions need no specific treatment; antipyretic medication (e.g. paracetamol), is commonly used to reduce fever and prevent further convulsions but evidence to support this practice is lacking. Prolonged febrile convulsions (those lasting 5 minutes or longer), or recurrent febrile convulsions without recovery must be treated actively (as for convulsive status epilepticus). Long-term anticonvulsant prophylaxis for febrile convulsions is rarely indicated.

Intracavernosal, urethral or topical application of vasoactive drugs under careful medical supervision are used for the management of erectile dysfunction. Intracavernosal or intraurethral preparations can also be used in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.

Erectile disorders may also be treated with drugs given by mouth which increase the blood flow to the penis. Drugs should be used with caution if the penis is deformed (e.g. in angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, and Peyronie’s disease).

Priapism

If priapism occurs with alprostadil, treatment should not be delayed more than 6 hours and is as follows:

Initial therapy by penile aspiration—using aseptic technique a 19–21 gauge butterfly needle inserted into the corpus cavernosum and 20–50 mL of blood aspirated; if necessary the procedure may be repeated on the opposite side.

If initial aspiration is unsuccessful a second 19–21 gauge butterfly needle can be inserted into the opposite corpus cavernosum and sterile physiological saline introduced through the first needle and drained through the second.

If aspiration and lavage of corpora are unsuccessful, cautious intracavernosal injection of a sympathomimetic with action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, continuously monitoring blood pressure and pulse (extreme caution: coronary heart disease, hypertension, cerebral ischaemia or if taking antidepressant) can be given.

If necessary the sympathomimetic injections can be followed by further aspiration of blood through the same butterfly needle.

If sympathomimetics unsuccessful, urgent surgical referral for management (possibly including shunt procedure).

Prescribing on the NHS

Some drug treatments for erectile dysfunction may only be prescribed on the NHS under certain circumstances; for details see the criteria listed in part XVIIIB of the Drug Tariff (Part XIb of the Northern Ireland Drug Tariff, Part 12 of the Scottish Drug Tariff). The Drug Tariffs can be accessed online at: National Health Service Drug Tariff for England and Wales:www.ppa.org.uk/ppa/edt_intro.htm

Health and Personal Social Services for Northern Ireland Drug Tariff:www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/pas-tariff

Scottish Drug Tariff:www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Prescribing-and-Medicines/Scottish-Drug-Tariff/

Alprostadil

Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) is given by intracavernosal injection, intraurethral application, or topical application for the management of erectile dysfunction (after exclusion of treatable medical causes). Intracavernosal or intraurethral preparations can also be used in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.

Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors

Avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil are phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors licensed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction; they are not recommended for use with other treatments for erectile dysfunction. The patient should be assessed appropriately before prescribing avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil. Since these drugs are given by mouth there is a potential for drug interactions.

Papaverine and phentolamine

Although not licensed the smooth muscle relaxant papaverine has also been given by intracavernosal injection for erectile dysfunction. Patients with neurological or psychogenic impotence are more sensitive to the effect of papaverine than those with vascular abnormalities. Phentolamine mesilate is added if the response is inadequate [unlicensed indication].

Persistence of the erection for longer than 4 hours is an emergency.

Most acute superficial eye infections can be treated topically. Blepharitis and conjunctivitis are often caused by staphylococci; keratitis and endophthalmitis may be bacterial, viral, or fungal.

Bacterial blepharitis is treated by application of an antibacterial eye ointment to the conjunctival sac or to the lid margins. Systemic treatment may occasionally be required and is usually undertaken after culturing organisms from the lid margin and determining their antimicrobial sensitivity; antibiotics such as the tetracyclines given for 3 months or longer may be appropriate.

Most cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self limiting; where treatment is appropriate, antibacterial eye drops or an eye ointment are used. A poor response might indicate viral or allergic conjunctivitis.

Corneal ulcer and keratitis require specialist treatment and may call for hospital admission for intensive therapy.

Endophthalmitis is a medical emergency which also calls for specialist management and requires intravitreal administration of antimicrobials; concomitant systemic treatment is required in some cases. Surgical intervention, such as vitrectomy, is sometimes indicated.

Antibacterials

Bacterial eye infections are generally treated topically with eye drops and eye ointments. Systemic administration is sometimes appropriate in blepharitis.

Chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity and is the drug of choice for superficial eye infections. Chloramphenicol eye drops are well tolerated and the recommendation that chloramphenicol eye drops should be avoided because of an increased risk of aplastic anaemia is not well founded.

Other antibacterials with a broad spectrum of activity include the quinolones, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin; the aminoglycosides, gentamicin and tobramycin are also active against a wide variety of bacteria. Gentamicin, tobramycin, quinolones (except moxifloxacin), and polymyxin B are effective for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Ciprofloxacin eye drops are licensed for corneal ulcers; intensive application (especially in the first 2 days) is required throughout the day and night.

Azithromycin eye drops are licensed for trachomatous conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and for purulent bacterial conjunctivitis. Trachoma which results from chronic infection with Chlamydia trachomatis can be treated with azithromycin by mouth [unlicensed indication].

Fusidic acid is useful for staphylococcal infections.

Propamidine isetionate is of little value in bacterial infections but is used by specialists to treat the rare, but potentially sight-threatening, condition of acanthamoeba keratitis [unlicensed indication].

Cefuroxime can be administered by intracameral injection for the prophylaxis of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery.

With corticosteroids

Many antibacterial preparations also incorporate a corticosteroid but such mixtures should not be used unless a patient is under close specialist supervision. In particular they should not be prescribed for undiagnosed ‘red eye’ which is sometimes caused by the herpes simplex virus and may be difficult to diagnose.

Administration

Frequency of application depends on the severity of the infection and the potential for irreversible ocular damage; antibacterial eye preparations are usually administered as follows:

Eye drops, apply 1 drop at least every 2 hours then reduce frequency as infection is controlled and continue for 48 hours after healing.Eye ointment, apply either at night (if eye drops used during the day) or 3–4 times daily (if eye ointment used alone).Antifungals

Fungal infections of the cornea are rare but can occur after agricultural injuries, especially in hot and humid climates. Orbital mycosis is rarer, and when it occurs it is usually because of direct spread of infection from the paranasal sinuses. Increasing age, debility, or immunosuppression can encourage fungal proliferation. The spread of infection through blood occasionally produces metastatic endophthalmitis.

Many different fungi are capable of producing ocular infection; they can be identified by appropriate laboratory procedures.

Antifungal preparations for the eye are not generally available. Treatment will normally be carried out at specialist centres, but requests for information about supplies of preparations not available commercially should be addressed to the Strategic Health Authority (or equivalent), or to the nearest hospital ophthalmology unit, or to Moorfields Eye Hospital, 162 City Road, London EC1V 2PD (tel. (020) 7253 3411) or www.moorfields.nhs.uk.

Antivirals

Herpes simplex infections producing, for example, dendritic corneal ulcers can be treated with aciclovir or ganciclovir. Aciclovir eye ointment is used in combination with systemic treatment for ophthalmic zoster.

Slow-release ocular implants containing ganciclovir (available on a named-patient basis from specialist importing companies) may be inserted surgically to treat immediate sight-threatening CMV retinitis. Local treatments do not protect against systemic infection or infection in the other eye. See systemic treatment of CMV retinitis.

Drugs used to prepare the eye for surgery, drugs that are injected into the anterior chamber at the time of surgery, and those used after eye surgery, are included here.

Cefuroxime, administered by intra-ocular injection into the anterior chamber of the eye (intracameral use), is used for the prophylaxis of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops such as diclofenac sodium, flurbiprofen, ketorolac trometamol, and nepafenac, are used for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammation, pain, and other symptoms associated with ocular surgery or laser treatment of the eye. Bromfenac is used for the treatment of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery. Diclofenac sodium and flurbiprofen are also used to prevent miosis during ocular surgery.

Apraclonidine, an alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist, reduces intra-ocular pressure possibly by reducing the production of aqueous humour. It is used to control increases in intra-ocular pressure associated with ocular surgery and as short-term treatment to reduce intraocular pressure prior to surgery.

Acetylcholine chloride, administered into the anterior chamber of the eye during surgery, rapidly produces miosis which lasts approximately 20 minutes. If prolonged miosis is required, it can be applied again.

Intra-ocular sodium hyaluronate and balanced salt solution are used during surgical procedures on the eye.

Povidone-iodine is used for peri-ocular and conjunctival antisepsis before ocular surgery to support postoperative infection control.

Local anaesthetics

Oxybuprocaine hydrochloride and tetracaine are widely used topical local anaesthetics. Proxymetacaine hydrochloride causes less initial stinging and is useful for children. Oxybuprocaine hydrochloride or a combined preparation of lidocaine hydrochloride and fluorescein sodium is used for tonometry. Tetracaine produces a more profound anaesthesia and is suitable for use before minor surgical procedures, such as the removal of corneal sutures. It has a temporary disruptive effect on the corneal epithelium. Lidocaine hydrochloride, with or without adrenaline/epinephrine, is injected into the eyelids for minor surgery. Local anaesthetics should never be used for the management of ocular symptoms.

    <p>Drugs are most commonly administered to the eye by topical application as eye drops or eye ointments. When a higher drug concentration is required within the eye, a local injection may be necessary.</p>
    <p>Eye-drop dispenser devices are available to aid the instillation of eye drops from plastic bottles and some are prescribable on the NHS (consult Drug Tariff—see Appliances and Reagents).

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Eye drops and eye ointments</p>
      <p>Eye drops are generally instilled into the pocket formed by gently pulling down the lower eyelid and keeping the eye closed for as long as possible after application; one drop is all that is needed. Instillation of more than one drop should be discouraged because it may increase systemic side-effects. A small amount of eye ointment is applied similarly; the ointment melts rapidly and blinking helps to spread it.</p>
      <p>When two different eye-drop preparations are used at the same time of day, dilution and overflow may occur when one immediately follows the other.

      <p>Systemic effects may arise from absorption of drugs into the general circulation from conjunctival vessels or from the nasal mucosa after the excess preparation has drained down through the tear ducts. The extent of systemic absorption following ocular administration is highly variable; nasal drainage of drugs is associated with eye drops much more often than with eye ointments. Pressure on the lacrimal punctum for at least a minute after applying eye drops reduces nasolacrimal drainage and therefore decreases systemic absorption from the nasal mucosa.</p>

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Control of microbial contamination</p>
    <p>Preparations for the eye should be sterile when issued. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of the contents during use.</p>
    <p>Eye drops in multiple-application containers for <i>domiciliary use</i> should not be used for more than 4 weeks after first opening (unless otherwise stated by the manufacturer).</p>
    <p>Multiple application eye drops for use in <i>hospital wards</i> are normally discarded 1 week after first opening—local practice may vary. Individual containers should be provided for each patient. A separate container should be supplied for each eye only if there are special concerns about contamination. Containers used before an eye operation should be discarded at the time of the operation and fresh containers supplied postoperatively. A fresh supply should also be provided upon discharge from hospital; in specialist ophthalmology units, it may be acceptable to issue containers that have been dispensed to the patient on the day of discharge.</p>
    <p>In <i>out-patient departments</i> single-application containers should be used; if multiple-application containers are used, they should be discarded after single patient use within one clinical session.</p>
    <p>In <i>eye surgery</i> single-application containers should be used if possible; if a multiple-application container is used, it should be discarded after single use. Preparations used during intra-ocular procedures and others that may penetrate into the anterior chamber must be isotonic and without preservatives and buffered if necessary to a neutral pH. Specially formulated fluids should be used for intra-ocular surgery; intravenous infusion preparations are not usually suitable for this purpose (Hartmann’s solution may be used in some ocular surgery). For all surgical procedures, a previously unopened container is used for each patient.</p>

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Contact lenses</p>
    <p>For cosmetic reasons many people prefer to wear contact lenses rather than spectacles; contact lenses are also sometimes required for medical indications. Visual defects are corrected by either rigid (‘hard’ or gas permeable) lenses or soft (hydrogel or silicone hydrogel—in adults only) lenses; soft lenses are the most popular type, because they are initially the most comfortable, but they may not give the best vision. Lenses should usually be worn for a specified number of hours each day and removed for sleeping. The risk of infectious and non-infectious keratitis is increased by extended continuous contact lens wear, which is not recommended, except when medically indicated.</p>
    <p>Contact lenses require meticulous care. Poor compliance with directions for use, and with daily cleaning and disinfection, can result in complications including ulcerative keratitis or conjunctivitis. One-day disposable lenses, which are worn only once and therefore require no disinfection or cleaning, are becoming increasingly popular.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Acanthamoeba keratitis</i>, a painful and sight-threatening condition, is associated with ineffective lens cleaning and disinfection, the use of contaminated lens cases, or tap water coming into contact with the lenses. The condition is especially associated with the use of soft lenses (including frequently replaced lenses) and should be treated by specialists.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Contact lenses and drug treatment</p>
      <p>Special care is required in prescribing eye preparations for contact lens users. Some drugs and preservatives in eye preparations can accumulate in hydrogel lenses and may induce toxic and adverse reactions. Therefore, unless medically indicated, the lenses should be removed before instillation of the eye preparation and not worn during the period of treatment. Alternatively, unpreserved drops can be used. Eye drops may, however, be instilled while patients are wearing rigid corneal contact lenses. Ointment preparations should never be used in conjunction with contact lens wear; oily eye drops should also be avoided.</p>
      <p>Many drugs given systemically can also have adverse effects on contact lens wear. These include oral contraceptives (particularly those with a higher oestrogen content), drugs which reduce blink rate (e.g. anxiolytics, hypnotics, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants), drugs which reduce lacrimation (e.g. antihistamines, antimuscarinics, phenothiazines and related drugs, some beta-blockers, diuretics, and tricyclic antidepressants), and drugs which increase lacrimation (including <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ephedrine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1421\">ephedrine hydrochloride</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydralazine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1048\">hydralazine hydrochloride</xref>).

Eye lotions

These are solutions for the irrigation of the conjunctival sac. They act mechanically to flush out irritants or foreign bodies as a first-aid treatment. Sterile sodium chloride 0.9% solution is usually used. Clean water will suffice in an emergency.

Other preparations administered to the eye

Subconjunctival injection may be used to administer anti-infective drugs, mydriatics, or corticosteroids for conditions not responding to topical therapy; intracameral and intravitreal routes can also be used to administer certain drugs, for example antibacterials. These injections should only be used under specialist supervision.

Drugs such as antimicrobials and corticosteroids may be administered systemically to treat susceptible eye conditions.

Ophthalmic Specials

Certain eye drops, e.g. amphotericin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, colistimethate sodium, desferrioxamine mesilate, dexamethasone, gentamicin, and vancomycin can be prepared aseptically from material supplied for injection.

The Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the UK Ophthalmic Pharmacy Group have produced the Ophthalmic Specials Guidance to help prescribers and pharmacists manage and restrict the use of unlicensed eye preparations. ‘Specials’ should only be prescribed in situations where a licensed product is not suitable for a patient's needs. The Ophthalmic Specials Guidance can be accessed on the Royal College of Ophthalmologists website (www.rcophth.ac.uk). The guidance will be reviewed every six months to ensure the most accurate and up-to-date information is available.

Preservatives and sensitisers

Information on preservatives and substances identified as skin sensitisers is provided under Excipients statements in preparation entries. Very rarely, cases of corneal calcification have been reported with the use of phosphate-containing eye drops in patients with significantly damaged corneas—consult product literature for further information.

Control of microbial contamination

Preparations for the eye should be sterile when issued. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of the contents during use.

Eye drops in multiple-application containers for domiciliary use should not be used for more than 4 weeks after first opening (unless otherwise stated by the manufacturer).

Multiple application eye drops for use in hospital wards are normally discarded 1 week after first opening—local practice may vary. Individual containers should be provided for each patient. A separate container should be supplied for each eye only if there are special concerns about contamination. Containers used before an eye operation should be discarded at the time of the operation and fresh containers supplied postoperatively. A fresh supply should also be provided upon discharge from hospital; in specialist ophthalmology units, it may be acceptable to issue containers that have been dispensed to the patient on the day of discharge.

In out-patient departments single-application containers should be used; if multiple-application containers are used, they should be discarded after single patient use within one clinical session.

In eye surgery single-application containers should be used if possible; if a multiple-application container is used, it should be discarded after single use. Preparations used during intra-ocular procedures and others that may penetrate into the anterior chamber must be isotonic and without preservatives and buffered if necessary to a neutral pH. Specially formulated fluids should be used for intra-ocular surgery; intravenous infusion preparations are not usually suitable for this purpose (Hartmann’s solution may be used in some ocular surgery). For all surgical procedures, a previously unopened container is used for each patient.

Contact lenses

For cosmetic reasons many people prefer to wear contact lenses rather than spectacles; contact lenses are also sometimes required for medical indications. Visual defects are corrected by either rigid (‘hard’ or gas permeable) lenses or soft (hydrogel or silicone hydrogel—in adults only) lenses; soft lenses are the most popular type, because they are initially the most comfortable, but they may not give the best vision. Lenses should usually be worn for a specified number of hours each day and removed for sleeping. The risk of infectious and non-infectious keratitis is increased by extended continuous contact lens wear, which is not recommended, except when medically indicated.

Contact lenses require meticulous care. Poor compliance with directions for use, and with daily cleaning and disinfection, can result in complications including ulcerative keratitis or conjunctivitis. One-day disposable lenses, which are worn only once and therefore require no disinfection or cleaning, are becoming increasingly popular.

Acanthamoeba keratitis, a painful and sight-threatening condition, is associated with ineffective lens cleaning and disinfection, the use of contaminated lens cases, or tap water coming into contact with the lenses. The condition is especially associated with the use of soft lenses (including frequently replaced lenses) and should be treated by specialists.

Contact lenses and drug treatment

Special care is required in prescribing eye preparations for contact lens users. Some drugs and preservatives in eye preparations can accumulate in hydrogel lenses and may induce toxic and adverse reactions. Therefore, unless medically indicated, the lenses should be removed before instillation of the eye preparation and not worn during the period of treatment. Alternatively, unpreserved drops can be used. Eye drops may, however, be instilled while patients are wearing rigid corneal contact lenses. Ointment preparations should never be used in conjunction with contact lens wear; oily eye drops should also be avoided.

Many drugs given systemically can also have adverse effects on contact lens wear. These include oral contraceptives (particularly those with a higher oestrogen content), drugs which reduce blink rate (e.g. anxiolytics, hypnotics, antihistamines, and muscle relaxants), drugs which reduce lacrimation (e.g. antihistamines, antimuscarinics, phenothiazines and related drugs, some beta-blockers, diuretics, and tricyclic antidepressants), and drugs which increase lacrimation (including ephedrine hydrochloride and hydralazine hydrochloride). Other drugs that may affect contact lens wear are isotretinoin (can cause conjunctival inflammation), aspirin (salicylic acid appears in tears and can be absorbed by contact lenses—leading to irritation), and rifampicin and sulfasalazine (can discolour lenses).

Alteplase, streptokinase and urokinase can be used for other thromboembolic disorders such as deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Alteplase is also used for acute ischaemic stroke.

Urokinase is also licensed to restore the patency of occluded intravenous catheters and cannulas blocked with fibrin clots.

      <p>Compensation for potassium loss is especially necessary:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>in those taking digoxin or anti-arrhythmic drugs, where potassium depletion may induce arrhythmias;</li>
        <li>in patients in whom secondary hyperaldosteronism occurs, e.g. renal artery stenosis, cirrhosis of the liver, the nephrotic syndrome, and severe heart failure;</li>
        <li>in patients with excessive losses of potassium in the faeces, e.g. chronic diarrhoea associated with intestinal malabsorption or laxative abuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Measures to compensate for potassium loss may also be required in the elderly since they frequently take inadequate amounts of potassium in the diet (but see <b>warning</b> on <b>renal insufficiency</b>). Measures may also be required during long-term administration of drugs known to induce potassium loss (e.g. corticosteroids). Potassium supplements are <b>seldom required</b> with the small doses of diuretics given to treat hypertension; <b>potassium-sparing diuretics</b> (rather than potassium supplements) are recommended for prevention of hypokalaemia due to diuretics such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/furosemide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP815\">furosemide</xref> or the thiazides when these are given to eliminate oedema.</p>
      <p>If potassium salts are used for the prevention of hypokalaemia, then doses of potassium chloride daily (in divided doses) by mouth are suitable in patients taking a normal diet. <i>Smaller doses</i> must be used if there is <i>renal insufficiency (common in the elderly)</i> to reduce the<b> risk</b> of <b>hyperkalaemia</b>.</p>
      <p>Potassium salts cause nausea and vomiting and poor compliance is a major limitation to their effectiveness; when appropriate, potassium-sparing diuretics are preferable.</p>
      <p>When there is <i>established potassium depletion</i> larger doses may be necessary, the quantity depending on the severity of any continuing potassium loss (monitoring of plasma-potassium concentration and specialist advice would be required). Potassium depletion is frequently associated with chloride depletion and with metabolic alkalosis, and these disorders require correction.</p>

Replacement of fluid and electrolytes lost through diarrhoea can therefore be achieved by giving solutions containing sodium, potassium, and glucose or another carbohydrate such as rice starch.</p>
        <p>Oral rehydration solutions should:</p>

The electrolyte concentrations (intravenous fluid) table and the electrolyte content (gastro-intestinal secretions) table may be helpful in planning replacement electrolyte therapy; faeces, vomit, or aspiration should be saved and analysed where possible if abnormal losses are suspected.

Oral preparations for fluid and electrolyte imbalance

Sodium and potassium salts, may be given by mouth to prevent deficiencies or to treat established deficiencies of mild or moderate degree.

Oral potassium

Compensation for potassium loss is especially necessary:

in those taking digoxin or anti-arrhythmic drugs, where potassium depletion may induce arrhythmias;in patients in whom secondary hyperaldosteronism occurs, e.g. renal artery stenosis, cirrhosis of the liver, the nephrotic syndrome, and severe heart failure;in patients with excessive losses of potassium in the faeces, e.g. chronic diarrhoea associated with intestinal malabsorption or laxative abuse.Measures to compensate for potassium loss may also be required in the elderly since they frequently take inadequate amounts of potassium in the diet (but see warning on renal insufficiency). Measures may also be required during long-term administration of drugs known to induce potassium loss (e.g. corticosteroids). Potassium supplements are seldom required with the small doses of diuretics given to treat hypertension; potassium-sparing diuretics (rather than potassium supplements) are recommended for prevention of hypokalaemia due to diuretics such as furosemide or the thiazides when these are given to eliminate oedema.

If potassium salts are used for the prevention of hypokalaemia, then doses of potassium chloride daily (in divided doses) by mouth are suitable in patients taking a normal diet. Smaller doses must be used if there is renal insufficiency (common in the elderly) to reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia.

Potassium salts cause nausea and vomiting and poor compliance is a major limitation to their effectiveness; when appropriate, potassium-sparing diuretics are preferable.

When there is established potassium depletion larger doses may be necessary, the quantity depending on the severity of any continuing potassium loss (monitoring of plasma-potassium concentration and specialist advice would be required). Potassium depletion is frequently associated with chloride depletion and with metabolic alkalosis, and these disorders require correction.

Management of hyperkalaemia

Acute severe hyperkalaemia (plasma-potassium concentration above 6.5 mmol/litre or in the presence of ECG changes) calls for urgent treatment with calcium gluconate 10% by slow intravenous injection, titrated and adjusted to ECG improvement, to temporarily protect against myocardial excitability. An intravenous injection of soluble insulin (5–10 units) with 50 mL glucose 50%, reduces serum-potassium concentration; this is repeated if necessary or a continuous infusion instituted. Salbutamol [unlicensed indication], by nebulisation or slow intravenous injection may also reduce plasma-potassium concentration; it should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. The correction of causal or compounding acidosis with sodium bicarbonate infusion should be considered (important: preparations of sodium bicarbonate and calcium salts should not be administered in the same line—risk of precipitation). Drugs exacerbating hyperkalaemia should be reviewed and stopped as appropriate; occasionally haemodialysis is needed.

Ion-exchange resins may be used to remove excess potassium in mildhyperkalaemia or in moderatehyperkalaemia when there are no ECG changes.

Oral sodium and water

Sodium chloride is indicated in states of sodium depletion and usually needs to be given intravenously. In chronic conditions associated with mild or moderate degrees of sodium depletion, e.g. in salt-losing bowel or renal disease, oral supplements of sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, according to the acid-base status of the patient, may be sufficient.

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)

As a worldwide problem diarrhoea is by far the most important indication for fluid and electrolyte replacement. Intestinal absorption of sodium and water is enhanced by glucose (and other carbohydrates). Replacement of fluid and electrolytes lost through diarrhoea can therefore be achieved by giving solutions containing sodium, potassium, and glucose or another carbohydrate such as rice starch.

Oral rehydration solutions should:

enhance the absorption of water and electrolytes;replace the electrolyte deficit adequately and safely;contain an alkalinising agent to counter acidosis;be slightly hypo-osmolar (about 250 mmol/litre) to prevent the possible induction of osmotic diarrhoea;be simple to use in hospital and at home;be palatable and acceptable, especially to children;be readily available.It is the policy of the World Health Organization (WHO) to promote a single oral rehydration solution but to use it flexibly (e.g. by giving extra water between drinks of oral rehydration solution to moderately dehydrated infants).

The WHO oral rehydration salts formulation contains sodium chloride 2.6 g, potassium chloride 1.5 g, sodium citrate 2.9 g, anhydrous glucose 13.5 g. Its is dissolved in sufficient water to produce 1 litre (providing Na+  75 mmol, K+ 20 mmol, Cl– 65 mmol, citrate 10 mmol, glucose 75 mmol/litre). This formulation is recommended by the WHO and the United Nations Children's fund, but it is not commonly used in the UK.

Oral rehydration solutions used in the UK are lower in sodium (50–60 mmol/litre) than the WHO formulation since, in general, patients suffer less severe sodium loss.

Rehydration should be rapid over 3 to 4 hours (except in hypernatraemic dehydration in which case rehydration should occur more slowly over 12 hours). The patient should be reassessed after initial rehydration and if still dehydrated rapid fluid replacement should continue.

Once rehydration is complete further dehydration is prevented by encouraging the patient to drink normal volumes of an appropriate fluid and by replacing continuing losses with an oral rehydration solution; in infants, breast-feeding or formula feeds should be offered between oral rehydration drinks.

See intravenous rehydration.

Oral bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate is given by mouth for chronic acidotic states such as uraemic acidosis or renal tubular acidosis. The dose for correction of metabolic acidosis is not predictable and the response must be assessed. For severe metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarbonate can be given intravenously.

Sodium bicarbonate may also be used to increase the pH of the urine; it is also used in dyspepsia.

Sodium supplements may increase blood pressure or cause fluid retention and pulmonary oedema in those at risk; hypokalaemia may be exacerbated.

Where hyperchloraemic acidosis is associated with potassium deficiency, as in some renal tubular and gastrointestinal disorders it may be appropriate to give oral potassium bicarbonate, although acute or severe deficiency should be managed by intravenous therapy.

Parenteral preparations for fluid and electrolyte imbalance

Electrolytes and water

Solutions of electrolytes are given intravenously, to meet normal fluid and electrolyte requirements or to replenish substantial deficits or continuing losses, when the patient is nauseated or vomiting and is unable to take adequate amounts by mouth. When intravenous administration is not possible, fluid (as sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5%) can also be given by subcutaneous infusion (hypodermoclysis).

The nature and severity of the electrolyte imbalance must be assessed from the history and clinical and biochemical investigations. Sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, and water depletion can occur singly and in combination with or without disturbances of acid-base balance.

Isotonic solutions may be infused safely into a peripheral vein. Solutions more concentrated than plasma, e.g. 20% glucose, are best given through an indwelling catheter positioned in a large vein.

Intravenous sodium

Sodium chloride in isotonic solution provides the most important extracellular ions in near physiological concentrations and is indicated in sodium depletion, which can arise from such conditions as gastro-enteritis, diabetic ketoacidosis, ileus, and ascites. In a severe deficit of 4 to 8 litres, 2 to 3 litres of isotonic sodium chloride may be given over 2 to 3 hours; thereafter the infusion can usually be at a slower rate.

Chronic hyponatraemia arising from inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone should ideally be corrected by fluid restriction. However, if sodium chloride is required for acute or chronic hyponatraemia, regardless of the cause, the deficit should be corrected slowly to avoid the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome and the rise in plasma-sodium concentration should not exceed 10 mmol/litre in 24 hours. In severe hyponatraemia, sodium chloride 1.8% may be used cautiously.

Compound sodium lactate (Hartmann’s solution) can be used instead of isotonic sodium chloride solution during or after surgery, or in the initial management of the injured or wounded; it may reduce the risk of hyperchloraemic acidosis.

Sodium chloride with glucose solutions are indicated when there is combined water and sodium depletion. A 1:1 mixture of isotonic sodium chloride and 5% glucose allows some of the water (free of sodium) to enter body cells which suffer most from dehydration while the sodium salt with a volume of water determined by the normal plasma Na+ remains extracellular.

Combined sodium, potassium, chloride, and water depletion may occur, for example, with severe diarrhoea or persistent vomiting; replacement is carried out with sodium chloride intravenous infusion 0.9% and glucose intravenous infusion 5% with potassium as appropriate.

Intravenous glucose

Glucose solutions (5%) are used mainly to replace water deficit. Average water requirements in a healthy adult are 1.5 to 2.5 litres daily and this is needed to balance unavoidable losses of water through the skin and lungs and to provide sufficient for urinary excretion. Water depletion (dehydration) tends to occur when these losses are not matched by a comparable intake, as may occur in coma or dysphagia or in the elderly or apathetic who may not drink enough water on their own initiative.

Excessive loss of water without loss of electrolytes is uncommon, occurring in fevers, hyperthyroidism, and in uncommon water-losing renal states such as diabetes insipidus or hypercalcaemia. The volume of glucose solution needed to replace deficits varies with the severity of the disorder, but usually lies within the range of 2 to 6 litres.

Glucose solutions are also used to correct and prevent hypoglycaemia and to provide a source of energy in those too ill to be fed adequately by mouth; glucose solutions are a key component of parenteral nutrition.

Glucose solutions are given in regimens with calcium and insulin for the emergency management of hyperkalaemia. They are also given, after correction of hyperglycaemia, during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, when they must be accompanied by continuing insulin infusion.

Intravenous potassium

Potassium chloride with sodium chloride intravenous infusion is the initial treatment for the correction of severe hypokalaemia and when sufficient potassium cannot be taken by mouth.

Repeated measurement of plasma-potassium concentration is necessary to determine whether further infusions are required and to avoid the development of hyperkalaemia, which is especially likely in renal impairment.

Initial potassium replacement therapy should not involve glucose infusions, because glucose may cause a further decrease in the plasma-potassium concentration.

Bicarbonate and lactate

Sodium bicarbonate is used to control severe metabolic acidosis (pH<7.1) particularly that caused by loss of bicarbonate (as in renal tubular acidosis or from excessive gastro-intestinal losses). Mild metabolic acidosis associated with volume depletion should first be managed by appropriate fluid replacement because acidosis usually resolves as tissue and renal perfusion are restored. In more severe metabolic acidosis or when the acidosis remains unresponsive to correction of anoxia or hypovolaemia, sodium bicarbonate (1.26%) can be infused over 3–4 hours with plasma-pH and electrolyte monitoring. In severe shock, for example in cardiac arrest, metabolic acidosis can develop without sodium or volume depletion; in these circumstances sodium bicarbonate is best given as a small volume of hypertonic solution, such as 50 mL of 8.4% solution intravenously.

Sodium lactate intravenous infusion is no longer used in metabolic acidosis because of the risk of producing lactic acidosis, particularly in seriously ill patients with poor tissue perfusion or impaired hepatic function. 

For chronic acidotic states, sodium bicarbonate can be given by mouth.

Plasma and plasma substitutes

Plasma and plasma substitutes (‘colloids’) contain large molecules that do not readily leave the intravascular space where they exert osmotic pressure to maintain circulatory volume. Compared to fluids containing electrolytes such as sodium chloride and glucose (‘crystalloids’), a smaller volume of colloid is required to produce the same expansion of blood volume, thereby shifting salt and water from the extravascular space. If resuscitation requires a volume of fluid that exceeds the maximum dose of the colloid then crystalloids can be given; packed red cells may also be required.

Albumin solution, prepared from whole blood, contain soluble proteins and electrolytes but no clotting factors, blood group antibodies, or plasma cholinesterases; they may be given without regard to the recipient’s blood group.

Albumin is usually used after the acute phase of illness, to correct a plasma-volume deficit; hypoalbuminaemia itself is not an appropriate indication. The use of albumin solution in acute plasma or blood loss may be wasteful; plasma substitutes are more appropriate. Concentrated albumin solution (20%) can be used under specialist supervision in patients with an intravascular fluid deficit and oedema because of interstitial fluid overload, to restore intravascular plasma volume with less exacerbation of the salt and water overload than isotonic solutions. Concentrated albumin solution may also be used to obtain a diuresis in hypoalbuminaemic patients (e.g. in hepatic cirrhosis).

Recent evidence does not support the previous view that the use of albumin increases mortality.

Plasma substitutes

Dextran, gelatin, and the hydroxyethyl starch, tetrastarch, are macromolecular substances which are metabolised slowly. Dextran and gelatin may be used at the outset to expand and maintain blood volume in shock arising from conditions such as burns or septicaemia; they may also be used as an immediate short-term measure to treat haemorrhage until blood is available. Dextran and gelatin are rarely needed when shock is due to sodium and water depletion because, in these circumstances, the shock responds to water and electrolyte repletion.

Hydroxyethyl starches should only be used for the treatment of hypovolaemia due to acute blood loss when crystalloids alone are not sufficient; they should be used at the lowest effective dose for the first 24 hours of fluid resuscitation.

Plasma substitutes should not be used to maintain plasma volume in conditions such as burns or peritonitis where there is loss of plasma protein, water, and electrolytes over periods of several days or weeks. In these situations, plasma or plasma protein fractions containing large amounts of albumin should be given.

Large volumes of some plasma substitutes can increase the risk of bleeding through depletion of coagulation factors.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Several different types of drug are given together during general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia is induced with either a volatile drug given by inhalation or with an intravenously administered drug; anaesthesia is maintained with an intravenous or inhalational anaesthetic. Analgesics , usually short-acting opioids, are also used. The use of neuromuscular blocking drugs necessitates intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. Following surgery, anticholinesterases can be given to reverse the effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs; specific antagonists can be used to reverse central and respiratory depression caused by some drugs used in surgery. A local topical anaesthetic can be used to reduce pain at the injection site.</p>
    <p>Individual requirements vary considerably and the recommended doses are only a guide. Smaller doses are indicated in ill, shocked, or debilitated patients and in significant hepatic impairment, while robust individuals may require larger doses. The required dose of induction agent may be less if the patient has been premedicated with a sedative agent or if an opioid analgesic has been used.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Intravenous anaesthetics</p>
    <p>Intravenous anaesthetics may be used either to induce anaesthesia or for maintenance of anaesthesia throughout surgery. Intravenous anaesthetics nearly all produce their effect in one arm-brain circulation time. Extreme care is required in surgery of the mouth, pharynx, or larynx where the airway may be difficult to maintain (e.g. in the presence of a tumour in the pharynx or larynx).</p>
    <p>To facilitate tracheal intubation, induction is usually followed by a neuromuscular blocking drug or a short-acting opioid.</p>
    <p>The doses of all intravenous anaesthetic drugs should be titrated to effect (except when using ‘rapid sequence induction’); lower doses may be required in premedicated patients.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Total intravenous anaesthesia</p>
      <p>This is a technique in which major surgery is carried out with all drugs given intravenously. Respiration can be spontaneous, or controlled with oxygen-enriched air. Neuromuscular blocking drugs can be used to provide relaxation and prevent reflex muscle movements. The main problem to be overcome is the assessment of depth of anaesthesia. Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) systems can be used to titrate intravenous anaesthetic infusions to predicted plasma-drug concentrations in ventilated adult patients.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Drugs used for intravenous anaesthesia</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propofol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8520\">Propofol</xref>, the most widely used intravenous anaesthetic, can be used for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia in adults and children, but it is not commonly used in neonates. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propofol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8520\">Propofol</xref> is associated with rapid recovery and less hangover effect than other intravenous anaesthetics. Propofol can also be used for sedation during diagnostic procedures and sedation in adults in intensive care.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/thiopental-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8523\">Thiopental sodium</xref> is a barbiturate that is used for induction of anaesthesia, but has no analgesic properties. Induction is generally smooth and rapid, but dose-related cardiovascular and respiratory depression can occur. Awakening from a moderate dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/thiopental-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8523\">thiopental sodium</xref> is rapid because the drug redistributes into other tissues, particularly fat. However, metabolism is slow and sedative effects can persist for 24 hours. Repeated doses have a cumulative effect and recovery is much slower.</p>

Several different types of drug are given together during general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia is induced with either a volatile drug given by inhalation or with an intravenously administered drug; anaesthesia is maintained with an intravenous or inhalational anaesthetic. Analgesics , usually short-acting opioids, are also used. The use of neuromuscular blocking drugs necessitates intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. Following surgery, anticholinesterases can be given to reverse the effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs; specific antagonists can be used to reverse central and respiratory depression caused by some drugs used in surgery. A local topical anaesthetic can be used to reduce pain at the injection site.

Individual requirements vary considerably and the recommended doses are only a guide. Smaller doses are indicated in ill, shocked, or debilitated patients and in significant hepatic impairment, while robust individuals may require larger doses. The required dose of induction agent may be less if the patient has been premedicated with a sedative agent or if an opioid analgesic has been used.

Intravenous anaesthetics

Intravenous anaesthetics may be used either to induce anaesthesia or for maintenance of anaesthesia throughout surgery. Intravenous anaesthetics nearly all produce their effect in one arm-brain circulation time. Extreme care is required in surgery of the mouth, pharynx, or larynx where the airway may be difficult to maintain (e.g. in the presence of a tumour in the pharynx or larynx).

To facilitate tracheal intubation, induction is usually followed by a neuromuscular blocking drug or a short-acting opioid.

The doses of all intravenous anaesthetic drugs should be titrated to effect (except when using ‘rapid sequence induction’); lower doses may be required in premedicated patients.

Total intravenous anaesthesia

This is a technique in which major surgery is carried out with all drugs given intravenously. Respiration can be spontaneous, or controlled with oxygen-enriched air. Neuromuscular blocking drugs can be used to provide relaxation and prevent reflex muscle movements. The main problem to be overcome is the assessment of depth of anaesthesia. Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) systems can be used to titrate intravenous anaesthetic infusions to predicted plasma-drug concentrations in ventilated adult patients.

Drugs used for intravenous anaesthesia

Propofol, the most widely used intravenous anaesthetic, can be used for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia in adults and children, but it is not commonly used in neonates. Propofol is associated with rapid recovery and less hangover effect than other intravenous anaesthetics. Propofol can also be used for sedation during diagnostic procedures and sedation in adults in intensive care.

Thiopental sodium is a barbiturate that is used for induction of anaesthesia, but has no analgesic properties. Induction is generally smooth and rapid, but dose-related cardiovascular and respiratory depression can occur. Awakening from a moderate dose of thiopental sodium is rapid because the drug redistributes into other tissues, particularly fat. However, metabolism is slow and sedative effects can persist for 24 hours. Repeated doses have a cumulative effect and recovery is much slower.

Etomidate is an intravenous agent associated with rapid recovery without a hangover effect. Etomidate causes less hypotension than thiopental sodium and propofol during induction. It produces a high incidence of extraneous muscle movements, which can be minimised by an opioid analgesic or a short-acting benzodiazepine given just before induction.

Ketamine is used rarely. Ketamine causes less hypotension than thiopental sodium and propofol during induction. It is used mainly for paediatric anaesthesia, particularly when repeated administration is required (such as for serial burns dressings); recovery is relatively slow and there is a high incidence of extraneous muscle movements. The main disadvantage of ketamine is the high incidence of hallucinations, nightmares, and other transient psychotic effects; these can be reduced by a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or midazolam.

Inhalational anaesthetics

Inhalational anaesthetics include gases and volatile liquids. Gaseous anaesthetics require suitable equipment for storage and administration. Volatile liquid anaesthetics are administered using calibrated vaporisers, using air, oxygen, or nitrous oxide-oxygen mixtures as the carrier gas. To prevent hypoxia, the inspired gas mixture should contain a minimum of 25% oxygen at all times. Higher concentrations of oxygen (greater than 30%) are usually required during inhalational anaesthesia when nitrous oxide is being administered.

Volatile liquid anaesthetics

Volatile liquid anaesthetics can be used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, and following induction with an intravenous anaesthetic.

Isoflurane is a volatile liquid anaesthetic. Heart rhythm is generally stable during isoflurane anaesthesia, but heart-rate can rise, particularly in younger patients. Systemic arterial pressure and cardiac output can fall, owing to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Muscle relaxation occurs and the effects of muscle relaxant drugs are potentiated. Isoflurane is the preferred inhalational anaesthetic for use in obstetrics.

Desflurane is a rapid acting volatile liquid anaesthetic; it is reported to have about one-fifth the potency of isoflurane. Emergence and recovery from anaesthesia are particularly rapid because of its low solubility. Desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia as it is irritant to the upper respiratory tract.

Sevoflurane is a rapid acting volatile liquid anaesthetic and is more potent than desflurane. Emergence and recovery are particularly rapid, but slower than desflurane. Sevoflurane is non-irritant and is therefore often used for inhalational induction of anaesthesia; it has little effect on heart rhythm compared with other volatile liquid anaesthetics.

Nitrous oxide

Nitrous oxide is used for maintenance of anaesthesia and, in sub-anaesthetic concentrations, for analgesia. For anaesthesia, nitrous oxide is commonly used in a concentration of 50 to 66% in oxygen as part of a balanced technique in association with other inhalational or intravenous agents. Nitrous oxide is unsatisfactory as a sole anaesthetic owing to lack of potency, but is useful as part of a combination of drugs since it allows a significant reduction in dosage.

For analgesia (without loss of consciousness), a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen containing 50% of each gas (Entonox, Equanox) is used. Self-administration using a demand valve is popular in obstetric practice, for changing painful dressings, as an aid to postoperative physiotherapy, and in emergency ambulances.

Nitrous oxide may have a deleterious effect if used in patients with an air-containing closed space since nitrous oxide diffuses into such a space with a resulting increase in pressure. This effect may be dangerous in conditions such as pneumothorax, which may enlarge to compromise respiration, or in the presence of intracranial air after head injury, entrapped air following recent underwater dive, or recent intra-ocular gas injection.

Malignant hyperthermia

Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but potentially lethal complication of anaesthesia. It is characterised by a rapid rise in temperature, increased muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and acidosis. The most common triggers of malignant hyperthermia are the volatile anaesthetics. Suxamethonium chloride has also been implicated, but malignant hyperthermia is more likely if it is given following a volatile anaesthetic. Volatile anaesthetics and suxamethonium chloride should be avoided during anaesthesia in patients at high risk of malignant hyperthermia.

Dantrolene sodium is used in the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

Glaucoma describes a group of disorders characterised by a loss of visual field associated with cupping of the optic disc and optic nerve damage. While glaucoma is generally associated with raised intra-ocular pressure, it can occur when the intra-ocular pressure is within the normal range.

The most common form of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma (chronic open-angle glaucoma), where drainage of the aqueous humour through the trabecular meshwork is restricted. The condition is often asymptomatic, but the patient may present with significant loss of visual-field. Patients with ocular hypertension are at high risk of developing primary open-angle glaucoma.

Drugs that reduce intra-ocular pressure by different mechanisms are available for managing ocular hypertension and glaucoma. A topical beta-blocker or a prostaglandin analogue is usually the drug of first choice for the treatment of ocular hypertension. A prostaglandin analogue should be used to manage patients with early or moderate primary open-angle glaucoma. After checking compliance and eye drop instillation technique, it may be necessary to combine these drugs or add others, such as sympathomimetics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, or miotics to control intra-ocular pressure.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Acute angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the outflow of aqueous humour from the eye is obstructed by bowing of the iris against the trabecular meshwork; it is a medical emergency that requires urgent reduction of intra-ocular pressure to prevent loss of vision. Patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma should be referred immediately for specialist ophthalmology assessment and treatment.

Standard antiglaucoma therapy is used if supplementary treatment is required after iridotomy, iridectomy, laser treatment, or drainage surgery in either primary open-angle or acute angle-closure glaucoma.

Beta-blockers

Topical application of a beta-blocker to the eye reduces intra-ocular pressure effectively in primary open-angle glaucoma, probably by reducing the rate of production of aqueous humour. Administration by mouth also reduces intra-ocular pressure but this route is not used since side-effects may be troublesome.

Beta-blockers used as eye drops include betaxolol, carteolol hydrochloride, levobunolol hydrochloride, and timolol maleate.

Prostaglandin analogues and prostamides

The prostaglandin analogues latanoprost, tafluprost and travoprost, and the synthetic prostamide, bimatoprost, increase uveoscleral outflow and subsequently reduce intra-ocular pressure. They are used to reduce intra-ocular pressure in ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.

Sympathomimetics

Brimonidine tartrate, a selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, is thought to lower intra-ocular pressure by reducing aqueous humour formation and increasing uveoscleral outflow. It is licensed for the reduction of intra-ocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in patients for whom beta-blockers are inappropriate; it may also be used as adjunctive therapy when intra-ocular pressure is inadequately controlled by other anti-glaucoma therapy.

Apraclonidine is another alpha2- adrenoceptor agonist that lowers intra-ocular pressure by reducing aqueous humour formation. Eye drops containing apraclonidine 0.5% are used short-term to delay laser treatment or surgery in patients with glaucoma not adequately controlled by another drug; eye drops containing 1% are used for control of intra-ocular pressure after anterior segment laser surgery. Apraclonidine may not provide additional benefit in patients already using two drugs that suppress the production of aqueous humour.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and systemic drugs

The carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,acetazolamide, brinzolamide, and dorzolamide, reduce intra-ocular pressure by reducing aqueous humour production. Systemic use of acetazolamide also produces weak diuresis.

Acetazolamide is given by mouth or by intravenous injection (intramuscular injections are painful because of the alkaline pH of the solution). It is used as an adjunct to other treatment for reducing intra-ocular pressure. Acetazolamide is not generally recommended for long-term use.

Dorzolamide and brinzolamide are topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. They are licensed for use in patients resistant to beta-blockers or those in whom beta-blockers are contra-indicated. They are used alone or as an adjunct to a topical beta-blocker. Brinzolamide can also be used as an adjunct to a prostaglandin analogue. Systemic absorption can rarely cause sulfonamide-like side-effects and may require discontinuation if severe.

The osmotic diuretics, intravenous hypertonic mannitol or glycerol by mouth are useful short-term ocular hypotensive drugs.

Miotics

Miotics act by opening the inefficient drainage channels in the trabecular meshwork.

Pilocarpine, a miotic, is not commonly used for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma because side-effects are poorly tolerated. It is used mainly in the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma and in some secondary glaucomas.

Danazol is licensed for the treatment of endometriosis and for the relief of severe pain and tenderness in benign fibrocystic breast disease where other measures have proved unsatisfactory. It may also be effective in the long-term management of hereditary angioedema [unlicensed indication].

Cetrorelix and ganirelix are luteinising hormone releasing hormone antagonists, which inhibit the release of gonadotrophins (luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone). They are used in the treatment of infertility by assisted reproductive techniques.

Gonadorelin analogues

Gonadorelin analogues are used in the treatment of endometriosis, precocious puberty, infertility, male hypersexuality with severe sexual deviation, anaemia due to uterine fibroids (together with iron supplementation), breast cancer, prostate cancer and before intra-uterine surgery. Use of leuprorelin acetate and triptorelin for 3 to 4 months before surgery reduces the uterine volume, fibroid size and associated bleeding. For women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy, a vaginal procedure is made more feasible following the use of a gonadorelin analogue.

Breast pain (mastalgia)

Once any serious underlying cause for breast pain has been ruled out, most women will respond to reassurance and reduction in dietary fat; withdrawal of an oral contraceptive or of hormone replacement therapy may help to resolve the pain.

Mild, non-cyclical breast pain is treated with simple analgesics; moderate to severe pain, cyclical pain or symptoms that persist for longer than 6 months may require specific drug treatment.

Danazol is licensed for the relief of severe pain and tenderness in benign fibrocystic breast disease which has not responded to other treatment.

Tamoxifen may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of mastalgia [unlicensed indication] especially when symptoms can definitely be related to cyclic oestrogen production; it may be given on the days of the cycle when symptoms are predicted.

Treatment for breast pain should be reviewed after 6 months and continued if necessary. Symptoms recur in about 50% of women within 2 years of withdrawal of therapy but may be less severe.

It is important to distinguish drugs used for the treatment of acute attacks of gout from those used in the long-term control of the disease. The latter exacerbate and prolong the acute manifestations if started during an attack. The management of gout in adolescents requires specialist supervision.

Acute attacks of gout

Acute attacks of gout are usually treated with high doses of NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium, diclofenac potassium, etoricoxib, indometacin, ketoprofen, naproxen or sulindac. Colchicine is an alternative in patients in whom NSAIDs are contra-indicated. Aspirin is not indicated in gout. Allopurinol, febuxostat, and uricosurics are not effective in treating an acute attack and may prolong it indefinitely if started during the acute episode.

The use of colchicine is limited by the development of toxicity at higher doses, but it is of value in patients with heart failure since, unlike NSAIDs, it does not induce fluid retention; moreover, it can be given to patients receiving anticoagulants.

Oral or parenteral corticosteroids are an effective alternative in those who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or who are resistant to other treatments. Intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid can be used in acute monoarticular gout [unlicensed indication]. A corticosteroid by intramuscular injection can be effective in podagra.

Canakinumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody, can be used for the symptomatic treatment of frequent gouty arthritis attacks (at least 3 in the previous 12 months). It is licensed for use in patients whose condition has not responded adequately to treatment with NSAIDs or colchicine, or who are intolerant of them.

Long-term control of gout

Frequent recurrence of acute attacks of gout, the presence of tophi, or signs of chronic gouty arthritis may call for the initiation of long-term (‘interval’) treatment. For long-term control of gout the formation of uric acid from purines may be reduced with the xanthine-oxidase inhibitors allopurinol or febuxostat alternatively the uricosuric drug sulfinpyrazone may be used to increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Treatment should be continued indefinitely to prevent further attacks of gout by correcting the hyperuricaemia. These drugs should never be started during an acute attack; they are usually started 1–2 weeks after the attack has settled. The initiation of treatment may precipitate an acute attack, and therefore an anti-inflammatory analgesic or colchicine should be used as a prophylactic and continued for at least one month after the hyperuricaemia has been corrected. However, if an acute attack develops during treatment, then the treatment should continue at the same dosage and the acute attack treated in its own right.

Allopurinol is widely used and is especially useful in patients with renal impairment or urate stones when uricosuric drugs cannot be used; it is not indicated for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. It can cause rashes.

Febuxostat is licensed for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia where urate deposition has already occurred; it is not indicated for patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased, such as in malignant disease or in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

Sulfinpyrazone can be used instead of allopurinol or in conjunction with it in cases that are resistant to treatment.

Benzbromarone (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is a uricosuric drug that can be used in patients with mild renal impairment.

Crystallisation of urate in the urine can occur with the uricosuric drugs and it is important to ensure an adequate urine output especially in the first few weeks of treatment. As an additional precaution the urine may be rendered alkaline.

Aspirin and other salicylates antagonise the uricosuric drugs; they do not antagonise allopurinol but are nevertheless not indicated in gout.

Drug treatment of heart failure associated with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (left ventricular systolic dysfunction) is covered below; optimal management of heart failure with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction has not been established.

The treatment of chronic heart failure aims to relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, reduce the incidence of acute exacerbations, and reduce mortality. An ACE inhibitor, titrated to a ‘target dose’ (or the maximum tolerated dose if lower), together with a beta-blocker, form the basis of treatment for all patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

An ACE inhibitor is generally advised for patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction or symptomatic heart failure. An angiotensin-II receptor antagonist may be a useful alternative for patients who, because of side-effects such as cough, cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors; a relatively high dose of the angiotensin-II receptor antagonist may be required to produce benefit. Candesartan cilexetil or valsartan may be given under specialist supervision as adjuncts to an ACE inhibitor in the treatment of heart failure when other treatments are unsuitable; the concomitant use of this combination, together with an aldosterone antagonist or a potassium-sparing diuretic is not recommended.

The beta-blockers bisoprolol fumarate and carvedilol are of value in any grade of stable heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction; nebivolol is licensed for stable mild to moderate heart failure in patients over 70 years. Beta-blocker treatment should be started by those experienced in the management of heart failure, at a very low dose and titrated very slowly over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms may deteriorate initially, calling for adjustment of concomitant therapy.

The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone can be added to an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker in patients who continue to remain symptomatic (particularly in those with moderate to severe heart failure); low doses of spironolactone reduce symptoms and mortality in these patients. If spironolactone cannot be used, eplerenone may be considered for the management of heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction with evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or for chronic mild heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Close monitoring of serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium is necessary, particularly following any change in treatment or any change in the patient’s clinical condition.

Patients who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, or in whom they are contra-indicated, may be given isosorbide dinitrate with hydralazine hydrochloride but this combination may be poorly tolerated. The combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride may be considered in addition to standard therapy with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker in patients who continue to remain symptomatic (particularly in patients of African or Caribbean origin who have moderate to severe heart failure).

Digoxin improves symptoms of heart failure and exercise tolerance and reduces hospitalisation due to acute exacerbations but it does not reduce mortality. Digoxin is reserved for patients with worsening or severe heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who remain symptomatic despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker in combination with either an aldosterone antagonist, candesartan cilexetil, or isosorbide dinitrate with hydralazine hydrochloride.

Patients with fluid overload should also receive either a loop or a thiazide diuretic (with salt or fluid restriction where appropriate). A thiazide diuretic may be of benefit in patients with mild heart failure and good renal function; however, thiazide diuretics are ineffective in patients with poor renal function (eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) and a loop diuretic is preferred. If diuresis with a single diuretic is insufficient, a combination of a loop diuretic and a thiazide diuretic may be tried; addition of metolazone may also be considered but the resulting diuresis may be profound and care is needed to avoid potentially dangerous electrolyte disturbances.

Niclosamide [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is the most widely used drug for tapeworm infections and side-effects are limited to occasional gastro-intestinal upset, lightheadedness, and pruritus; it is not effective against larval worms. Fears of developing cysticercosis in Taenia solium infections have proved unfounded. All the same, an antiemetic can be given before treatment and a laxative can be given 2 hours after niclosamide.

Praziquantel [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is as effective as niclosamide.

Hydatid disease

Cysts caused by Echinococcus granulosus grow slowly and asymptomatic patients do not always require treatment. Surgical treatment remains the method of choice in many situations. Albendazole [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is used in conjunction with surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence or as primary treatment in inoperable cases. Alveolar echinococcosis due to E. multilocularis is usually fatal if untreated. Surgical removal with albendazole cover is the treatment of choice, but where effective surgery is impossible, repeated cycles of albendazole (for a year or more) may help. Careful monitoring of liver function is particularly important during drug treatment.

Drugs for hookworms

Hookworms (ancylostomiasis, necatoriasis) live in the upper small intestine and draw blood from the point of their attachment to their host. An iron-deficiency anaemia may occur and, if present, effective treatment of the infection requires not only expulsion of the worms but treatment of the anaemia.

Mebendazole has a useful broad-spectrum activity, and is effective against hookworms. Albendazole [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is an alternative. Levamisole is also is also effective in children.

Schistosomicides (bilharziasis)

Adult Schistosoma haematobium worms live in the genito-urinary veins and adult S. mansoni in those of the colon and mesentery.S. japonicum is more widely distributed in veins of the alimentary tract and portal system.

Praziquantel [unlicensed] is available from Merck Serono (Cysticide) and is effective against all human schistosomes. No serious adverse effects have been reported. Of all the available schistosomicides, it has the most attractive combination of effectiveness, broad-spectrum activity, and low toxicity.

Filaricides

Diethylcarbamazine [unlicensed] (available from ‘special- order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is effective against microfilariae and adults of Loa loa, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Brugia malayi. To minimise reactions, treatment in adults and children over 1 month, is commenced with a dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate on the first day and increased gradually over 3 days. Length of treatment varies according to infection type, and usually gives a radical cure for these infections. Close medical supervision is necessary particularly in the early phase of treatment.

In heavy infections there may be a febrile reaction, and in heavy Loa loa infection there is a small risk of encephalopathy. In such cases specialist advice should be sought, and treatment must be given under careful in-patient supervision and stopped at the first sign of cerebral involvement.

Ivermectin [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is very effective in onchocerciasis and it is now the drug of choice; reactions are usually slight. Diethylcarbamazine or suramin should no longer be used for onchocerciasis because of their toxicity.

Drugs for cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption)

Dog and cat hookworm larvae may enter human skin where they produce slowly extending itching tracks usually on the foot. Single tracks can be treated with topical tiabendazole (no commercial preparation available). Multiple infections respond to ivermectin, albendazole or tiabendazole (thiabendazole) by mouth [all unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies).

Drugs for strongyloidiasis

Adult Strongyloides stercoralis live in the gut and produce larvae which penetrate the gut wall and invade the tissues, setting up a cycle of auto-infection. Ivermectin [unlicensed] (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is the treatment of choice for chronic Strongyloides infection in adults and children over 5 years. Albendazole [unlicensed] (available from ‘special order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) is an alternative given to adults and children over 2 years.

Treatment for viral hepatitis should be initiated by a specialist. The management of uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis is largely symptomatic. Early treatment of acute hepatitis C with interferon alfa [unlicensed indication] may reduce the risk of chronic infection. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses are major causes of chronic hepatitis. Active or passive immunisation against hepatitis A and B infections can be given.

Chronic hepatitis B

Peginterferon alfa is an option for the initial treatment of chronic hepatitis B and may be preferable to interferon alfa. The use of peginterferon alfa and interferon alfa is limited by a response rate of 30–40% and relapse is frequent. Treatment should be discontinued if no improvement occurs after 4 months. The manufacturers of peginterferon alfa-2a and interferon alfa contraindicate use in decompensated liver disease, but low doses can be used with great caution in these patients. Although interferon alfa is contra-indicated in patients receiving immunosuppressant treatment (or who have received it recently), cautious use of peginterferon alfa-2a may be justified in some cases.

Entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil are options for the initial treatment of chronic hepatitis B. If the response is inadequate after 6–9 months of treatment, a change in treatment should be considered. Other drugs that are licensed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B include adefovir dipivoxil, lamivudine, or telbivudine.

Entecavir alone, tenofovir disoproxil alone, or a combination of lamivudine with either adefovir dipivoxil or tenofovir disoproxil can be used in patients with decompensated liver disease.

If drug-resistant hepatitis B virus emerges during treatment, another antiviral drug to which the virus is sensitive should be added. Hepatitis B viruses with reduced susceptibility to lamivudine have emerged following extended therapy. Adefovir dipivoxil or tenofovir disoproxil can be given with lamivudine in lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B; telbivudine or entecavir should not be used because cross-resistance can occur.

If there is no toxicity or loss in efficacy, treatment with adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine, or tenofovir disoproxil is usually continued until 6 months after adequate seroconversion has occurred. Treatment is usually continued long-term in patients with decompensated liver disease.

Tenofovir disoproxil, or a combination of tenofovir disoproxil with either emtricitabine or lamivudine may be used with other antiretrovirals, as part of ‘highly active antiretroviral therapy’ in patients who require treatment for both HIV and chronic hepatitis B. If patients infected with both HIV and chronic hepatitis B only require treatment for chronic hepatitis B, they should receive antivirals that are not active against HIV, such as peginterferon alfa or adefovir dipivoxil. Treatment may be continued long-term, even if adequate seroconversion occurs. Management of these patients should be coordinated between HIV and hepatology specialists.

Chronic hepatitis C

Before starting treatment, the genotype of the infecting hepatitis C virus should be determined and the viral load measured as this may affect the choice and duration of treatment. A combination of ribavirin and peginterferon alfa is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa is less effective than the combination of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Peginterferon alfa alone should be used if ribavirin is contra-indicated or not tolerated. Ribavirin monotherapy is ineffective.

Boceprevir and telaprevir are protease inhibitors that inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus genotype 1, but they are less effective against other genotypes of the virus. Monotherapy is not recommended because there is a high likelihood of resistance developing. Either boceprevir or telaprevir is licensed for use in combination with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of genotype 1 in patients with compensated liver disease; these combinations are more effective than dual therapy with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa. However, triple therapy is associated with a higher incidence and greater severity of anaemia than dual therapy. Neutropenia seems to be more frequent during treatment with regimens containing boceprevir than with those containing telaprevir. Rash is a particular concern with telaprevir, and to a lesser extent with boceprevir.

Daclatasvir is licensed for use in combination with sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of genotypes 1 or 4, with or without compensated cirrhosis; the addition of ribavirin should be considered for patients with advanced liver disease or with other negative prognostic factors, such as prior treatment experience. It is also licensed in combination with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of genotype 3 in patients who are treatment experienced, with or without compensated cirrhosis, and in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of genotype 4. Daclatasvir must not be given as monotherapy.

Sofosbuvir is a pro-drug of a nucleoside inhibitor that is effective against hepatitis C virus polymerase NS5B. It is licensed for use in combination with ribavirin, with or without peginterferon alfa, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 in patients with compensated liver disease. Sofosbuvir monotherapy is not recommended because it is less effective than combination therapy.

Simeprevir is licensed for use in combination with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of genotype 1 or 4; regimens containing peginterferon alfa-2b are less effective than those containing peginterferon alfa-2a. Simeprevir may also be used in combination with sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, for the urgent treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of genotypes 1 or 4 only when peginterferon alfa cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications. Simeprevir monotherapy is not recommended.

      <p>Regardless of immune function and the use of any immunoglobulins, neonates with <i>chickenpox</i> should be treated with a parenteral antiviral to reduce the risk of severe disease. Oral therapy in children is not recommended as absorption is variable. Chickenpox in otherwise healthy children between 1 month and 12 years is usually mild and antiviral treatment is not usually required.</p>
      <p>Chickenpox is more severe in adolescents and adults than in children; antiviral treatment started within 24 hours of the onset of rash may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms in otherwise healthy adults and adolescents. Antiviral treatment is generally recommended in immunocompromised patients and those at special risk (e.g. because of severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease or chronic skin disorder); in such cases, an antiviral is given for 10 days with at least 7 days of parenteral treatment.</p>
      <p>Pregnant women who develop severe chickenpox may be at risk of complications, especially varicella pneumonia. Specialist advice should be sought for the treatment of chickenpox during pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Those who have been exposed to chickenpox and are at special risk of complications may require prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (see under Disease Specific Immunoglobulins).</p>
      <p>In <i>herpes zoster</i> (shingles) systemic antiviral treatment can reduce the severity and duration of pain, reduce complications, and reduce viral shedding. Treatment with the antiviral should be started within 72 hours of the onset of rash and is usually continued for 7–10 days. Immunocompromised patients at high risk of disseminated or severe infection should be treated with a parenteral antiviral drug.</p>
      <p>Chronic pain which persists after the rash has healed (postherpetic neuralgia) requires specific management.</p>

Immunocompromised patients at high risk of disseminated or severe infection should be treated with a parenteral antiviral drug.

Chronic pain which persists after the rash has healed (postherpetic neuralgia) requires specific management.

Choice

Aciclovir is active against herpesviruses but does not eradicate them. Uses of aciclovir include systemic treatment of varicella–zoster and the systemic and topical treatment of herpes simplex infections of the skin and mucous membranes. It is used by mouth for severe herpetic stomatitis. Aciclovir eye ointment is used for herpes simplex infections of the eye; it is combined with systemic treatment for ophthalmic zoster.

Famciclovir, a prodrug of penciclovir, is similar to aciclovir and is licensed for use in herpes zoster and genital herpes.

Valaciclovir is an ester of aciclovir, licensed for herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections of the skin and mucous membranes (including genital herpes); it is also licensed for preventing cytomegalovirus disease following solid organ transplantation. Famciclovir or valaciclovir are suitable alternatives to aciclovir for oral lesions associated with herpes zoster. Valaciclovir once daily may reduce the risk of transmitting genital herpes to heterosexual partners—specialist advice should be sought.

Foscarnet sodium is used for mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus infection unresponsive to aciclovir in immunocompromised patients; it is toxic and can cause renal impairment.

Inosine pranobex has been used by mouth for herpes simplex infections; its effectiveness remains unproven.

Cytomegalovirus infection

Ganciclovir is related to aciclovir but it is more active against cytomegalovirus (CMV); it is also much more toxic than aciclovir and should therefore be prescribed only when the potential benefit outweighs the risks. Ganciclovir is administered by intravenous infusion for the initial treatment of CMV infection. Ganciclovir causes profound myelosuppression when given with zidovudine; the two should not normally be given together particularly during initial ganciclovir therapy. The likelihood of ganciclovir resistance increases in patients with a high viral load or in those who receive the drug over a long duration.

Valaciclovir is licensed for prevention of cytomegalovirus disease following renal transplantation.

Valganciclovir is an ester of ganciclovir which is licensed for the initial treatment and maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients.Valganciclovir is also licensed for preventing CMV disease following solid organ transplantation from a cytomegalovirus-positive donor.

Foscarnet sodium is also active against cytomegalovirus; it is toxic and can cause renal impairment.

There is no cure for infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but a number of drugs slow or halt disease progression. Drugs for HIV infection (antiretrovirals) may be associated with serious side-effects. Although antiretrovirals increase life expectancy considerably and decrease the risk of complications associated with premature ageing, mortality and morbidity remain slightly higher than in uninfected individuals. Treatment should be undertaken only by those experienced in their use.

Principles of treatment

Treatment aims to prevent the mortality and morbidity associated with chronic HIV infection whilst minimising drug toxicity. Although it should be started before the immune system is irreversibly damaged, the need for early drug treatment should be balanced against the risk of toxicity. Commitment to treatment and strict adherence over many years are required; the regimen chosen should take into account convenience and patient tolerance. The development of drug resistance is reduced by using a combination of drugs; such combinations should have synergistic or additive activity while ensuring that their toxicity is not additive. It is recommended that viral sensitivity to antiretroviral drugs is established before starting treatment or before switching drugs if the infection is not responding.

Treatment also reduces the risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners, but the risk is not eliminated completely; this risk and strategies to reduce HIV transmission should be discussed with patients and their sexual partners.

Initiation of treatment

The optimum time for initiating antiretroviral treatment depends primarily on the CD4 cell count. The timing and choice of treatment should also take account of clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and the possible effect of antiretroviral drugs on factors such as the risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment includes a combination of drugs known as ‘highly active antiretroviral therapy’. Treatment of HIV-1 infection is initiated with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or a boosted protease inhibitor, or an integrase inhibitor; the regimens of choice contain tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine witheitherefavirenzorritonavir-boosted atazanavir, orritonavir-boosted darunavir, orraltegravir. Alternative regimens contain abacavir and lamivudine with eitherlopinavir with ritonavir, orritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir, ornevirapine, orrilpivirine. Patients who require treatment for both HIV and chronic hepatitis B should be treated with antivirals active against both diseases.

Switching therapy

Deterioration of the condition (including clinical and virological changes) may require a change in therapy. The choice of an alternative regimen depends on factors such as the response to previous treatment, tolerance and the possibility of cross-resistance.

Pregnancy

Treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy aims to reduce the risk of toxicity to the fetus (although information on the teratogenic potential of most antiretroviral drugs is limited), to minimise the viral load and disease progression in the mother, and to prevent transmission of infection to the neonate. All treatment options require careful assessment by a specialist. Combination antiretroviral therapy maximises the chance of preventing transmission and represents optimal therapy for the mother. However, it may be associated with a greater risk of preterm delivery. Pregnancies in HIV-positive women and babies born to them should be reported prospectively to the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood at www.ucl.ac.uk/nshpc/and to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry at www.apregistry.com.

Breast-feeding

Breast-feeding by HIV-positive mothers may cause HIV infection in the infant and should be avoided.

Post-exposure prophylaxis

Prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs [unlicensed indication] may be appropriate following exposure to HIV-contaminated material. Immediate expert advice should be sought in such cases; national guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers have been developed (by the Chief Medical Officer’s Expert Advisory Group on AIDS), www.gov.uk/dh and local ones may also be available. Antiretrovirals for prophylaxis are chosen on the basis of efficacy and potential for toxicity. Prompt prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs [unlicensed indication] is also appropriate following potential sexual exposure to HIV; recommendations have been developed by the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, www.bashh.org.

Drugs for HIV infection

Zidovudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (or ‘nucleoside analogue’), was the first anti-HIV drug to be introduced. Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors include abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, and tenofovir disoproxil.

The protease inhibitors include atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir (a pro-drug of amprenavir), indinavir, lopinavir (available as lopinavir with ritonavir), ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir. Indinavir is rarely used in the treatment of HIV-infection because it is associated with nephrolithiasis. Ritonavir in low doses boosts the activity of atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir (available as lopinavir with ritonavir), saquinavir, and tipranavir increasing the persistence of plasma concentrations of these drugs; at such a low dose, ritonavir has no intrinsic antiviral activity. The protease inhibitors are metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems and therefore have a significant potential for drug interactions. Protease inhibitors are associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic effects.

The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, and rilpivirine are used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, but not against the subtype HIV-2, a subtype that is rare in the UK. Nevirapine is associated with a high incidence of rash (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and occasionally fatal hepatitis. Rash is also associated with efavirenz and etravirine but it is usually milder. Psychiatric or CNS disturbances are common with efavirenz; CNS disturbances are often self-limiting and can be reduced by taking the dose at bedtime (especially in the first 2–4 weeks of treatment). Efavirenz has also been associated with an increased plasma-cholesterol concentration. Etravirine is used in regimens containing a boosted protease inhibitor for HIV infection resistant to other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.

Enfuvirtide, which inhibits the fusion of HIV to the host cell, is licensed for managing infection that has failed to respond to a regimen of other antiretroviral drugs; enfuvirtide should be combined with other potentially active antiretroviral drugs.

Maraviroc is an antagonist of the CCR5 chemokine receptor. It is licensed for patients exclusively infected with CCR5-tropic HIV.

Dolutegravir and raltegravir are inhibitors of HIV integrase. They are licensed for the treatment of HIV infection in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.

Elvitegravir is also an inhibitor of HIV integrase that is only available as a component of a fixed-dose combination product (tenofovir with cobicistat, elvitegravir and emtricitabine). Cobicistat is a pharmacokinetic enhancer that boosts the concentrations of other antiretrovirals, but it has no antiretroviral activity itself.

Immune reconstitution syndrome

Improvement in immune function as a result of antiretroviral treatment may provoke a marked inflammatory reaction against residual opportunistic organisms; these reactions may occur within the first few weeks or months of initiating treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease) have also been reported many months after initiation of treatment.

Lipodystrophy syndrome

Metabolic effects associated with antiretroviral treatment include fat redistribution, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia; collectively these have been termed lipodystrophy syndrome. The usual risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be taken into account before starting antiretroviral therapy and patients should be advised about lifestyle changes to reduce their cardiovascular risk. Plasma lipids and blood glucose should be measured before starting antiretroviral therapy, after 3–6 months of treatment, and then annually. 

Fat redistribution (with loss of subcutaneous fat, increased abdominal fat, ‘buffalo hump’ and breast enlargement) is associated with regimens containing protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Stavudine (especially in combination with didanosine), and to a lesser extent zidovudine, are associated with a higher risk of lipoatrophy and should be used only if alternative regimens are not suitable. 

Dyslipidaemia is associated with antiretroviral treatment, particularly with protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors and some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia. Of the protease inhibitors, atazanavir and darunavir may be less likely to cause dyslipidaemia, while saquinavir and atazanavir may be less likely to impair glucose tolerance. 

Osteonecrosis

Osteonecrosis has been reported in patients with advanced HIV disease or following long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy.

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Breast Cancer</p>
      <p>The management of patients with breast cancer involves surgery, radiotherapy, drug therapy, or a combination of these. For operable breast cancer, treatment before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) reduces the size of the tumour and facilitates breast-conserving surgery; hormone antagonist therapy (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/letrozole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5758\">letrozole</xref>) is chosen for steroid hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer and chemotherapy for steroid hormone-receptor-negative tumours or for younger women.</p>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Early breast cancer</p>
        <p>All women should be considered for adjuvant therapy following surgical removal of the tumour. Adjuvant therapy is used to eradicate the micrometastases that cause relapses. Choice of adjuvant treatment is determined by the risk of recurrence, steroid hormone-receptor status of the primary tumour, and menopausal status.</p>
        <p>Adjuvant therapy comprises cytotoxic chemotherapy and hormone-antagonist therapy. Women with steroid hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are considered for hormone-antagonist therapy (preceded by cytotoxic chemotherapy if necessary) whilst women with steroid hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer should be considered for cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Aromatase inhibitors act predominantly by blocking the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in the peripheral tissues. They do not inhibit ovarian oestrogen synthesis and should not be used in premenopausal women. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/anastrozole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5751\">Anastrozole</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/letrozole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5758\">letrozole</xref> are non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/exemestane.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5754\">exemestane</xref> is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

        <p outputclass=\"title\">Advanced breast cancer</p>
        <p>Treatment of advanced breast cancer depends on the patient’s drug history and an assessment of disease severity. Aromatase inhibitors, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/anastrozole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5751\">anastrozole</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/letrozole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5758\">letrozole</xref>, are the preferred treatment in postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, a long disease-free interval following treatment for early breast cancer, and disease limited to bone or soft tissues; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tamoxifen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5761\">tamoxifen</xref> can be used if aromatase inhibitors are not suitable. Progestogens, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/medroxyprogesterone-acetate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4491\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</xref>, may be used after aromatase inhibitors and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tamoxifen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5761\">tamoxifen</xref> in postmenopausal women.</p>

Hormonal manipulation has an important role in the treatment of breast, prostate, and endometrial cancer, and a more marginal role in the treatment of hypernephroma. These treatments are not curative, but may provide excellent palliation of symptoms in selected patients, sometimes for a period of years. Tumour response, and treatment toxicity should be carefully monitored and treatment changed if progression occurs or side-effects exceed benefit.

Oestrogens

Diethylstilbestrol is sometimes used to treat prostate cancer, but it is not usually used first-line because of its side-effects. It is occasionally used in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

Ethinylestradiol is the most potent oestrogen available; unlike other oestrogens it is only slowly metabolised in the liver.

Progestogens

Progestogens have a role in the treatment of endometrial cancer; their use in breast cancer and renal cell cancer has declined. Progestogens are now rarely used to treat prostate cancer. Medroxyprogesterone acetate or megestrol acetate are usually chosen and can be given orally; high-dose or parenteral treatment cannot be recommended.

Androgens

Testosterone esters have largely been superseded by other drugs for breast cancer.

Hormone Antagonists

Breast Cancer

The management of patients with breast cancer involves surgery, radiotherapy, drug therapy, or a combination of these. For operable breast cancer, treatment before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) reduces the size of the tumour and facilitates breast-conserving surgery; hormone antagonist therapy (e.g. letrozole) is chosen for steroid hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer and chemotherapy for steroid hormone-receptor-negative tumours or for younger women.

Early breast cancer

All women should be considered for adjuvant therapy following surgical removal of the tumour. Adjuvant therapy is used to eradicate the micrometastases that cause relapses. Choice of adjuvant treatment is determined by the risk of recurrence, steroid hormone-receptor status of the primary tumour, and menopausal status.

Adjuvant therapy comprises cytotoxic chemotherapy and hormone-antagonist therapy. Women with steroid hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are considered for hormone-antagonist therapy (preceded by cytotoxic chemotherapy if necessary) whilst women with steroid hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer should be considered for cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Aromatase inhibitors act predominantly by blocking the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in the peripheral tissues. They do not inhibit ovarian oestrogen synthesis and should not be used in premenopausal women. Anastrozole and letrozole are non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors; exemestane is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase inhibitors are usually prescribed as initial adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with oestrogen- receptor-positive tumours; tamoxifen, an oestrogen- receptor antagonist, is used if an aromatase inhibitor is not appropriate. Adjuvant hormone antagonist therapy should generally be continued for 5 years following removal of the tumour. In postmenopausal women considered for extended adjuvant therapy, 5 years of tamoxifen is followed by letrozole for a further 2–3 years.

Trastuzumab is licensed for use in early breast cancer which overexpresses human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) in women who have received surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (as appropriate).

Premenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer who decline chemotherapy may benefit from treatment with goserelin or ovarian ablation.

Advanced breast cancer

Treatment of advanced breast cancer depends on the patient’s drug history and an assessment of disease severity. Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole or letrozole, are the preferred treatment in postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, a long disease-free interval following treatment for early breast cancer, and disease limited to bone or soft tissues; tamoxifen can be used if aromatase inhibitors are not suitable. Progestogens, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, may be used after aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women.

Tamoxifen should be considered for pre- and perimenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer not previously treated with tamoxifen. Ovarian suppression is used in pre- and perimenopausal women who have had disease progression despite treatment with tamoxifen. The gonadorelin analogue goserelin is licensed for advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women suitable for hormone manipulation.

Trastuzumab emtansine can be used alone for treating HER2-positive, unresectable, locally advanced breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, or when there is disease recurrence during or following adjuvant therapy.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy is indicated for advanced steroid hormone-receptor-negative tumours and for aggressive disease, particularly when metastases involve visceral sites (e.g. the liver) or if the disease-free interval following treatment for early breast cancer is short.

Cytotoxic drugs used in breast cancer

An anthracycline combined with fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, and sometimes also with methotrexate is effective. Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil can be useful if an anthracycline is inappropriate (e.g. in cardiac disease).

Metastatic disease

The choice of chemotherapy regimen will be influenced by whether the patient has previously received adjuvant treatment and the presence of any co-morbidity.

For women who have not previously received chemotherapy, an anthracycline (such as doxorubicin hydrochloride or epirubicin hydrochloride) alone or in combination with another cytotoxic drug is the standard initial therapy for metastatic breast disease.

Patients with anthracycline-refractory or resistant disease should be considered for treatment with a taxane either alone or in combination with trastuzumab if they have tumours that overexpress HER2. Other cytotoxic drugs with activity against breast cancer include capecitabine, mitoxantrone, mitomycin, and vinorelbine. Trastuzumab alone is an option for chemotherapy-resistant cancers that overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab emtansine can be used as monotherapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, or when there is a disease recurrence during or following adjuvant therapy.

The use of bisphosphonates in patients with metastatic breast cancer may reduce pain and prevent skeletal complications of bone metastases.

Gonadorelin analogues and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists

Metastatic cancer of the prostate usually responds to hormonal treatment aimed at androgen depletion. Standard treatments include bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy or use of a gonadorelin analogue (buserelin, goserelin, leuprorelin acetate, or triptorelin). The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist, degarelix, is also available. Response in most patients lasts for 12 to 18 months. No entirely satisfactory therapy exists for disease progression despite this treatment (hormone-refractory prostate cancer), but occasional patients respond to other hormone manipulation e.g. with an anti-androgen. Bone disease can often be palliated with irradiation or, if widespread, with strontium ranelate or prednisolone.

Gonadorelin analogues

Gonadorelin analogues are as effective as orchidectomy or diethylstilbestrol but are expensive and require parenteral administration, at least initially. They cause initial stimulation then depression of luteinising hormone release by the pituitary.

Gonadorelin analogues are also used in women for breast cancer and other indications. The gonadorelin analogues cause side-effects similar to the menopause in women and orchidectomy in men.

Anti-androgens

Cyproterone acetate, flutamide and bicalutamide are anti-androgens that inhibit the tumour ‘flare’ which may occur after commencing gonadorelin analogue administration. Cyproterone acetate and flutamide are also licensed for use alone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer refractory to gonadorelin analogue therapy. Bicalutamide is used for prostate cancer either alone or as an adjunct to other therapy, according to the clinical circumstances. 

Abiraterone acetate (in combination with prednisone or prednisolone) and enzalutamide are licensed for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients whose disease has progressed during or after treatment with a docetaxel-containing chemotherapy regimen. Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are also used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. Medical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue should be continued during treatment in patients not surgically castrated.

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists

Degarelix is a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist used to treat advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer. It does not induce a testosterone surge or tumour ‘flare’, therefore anti-androgen therapy is not required.

Somatostatin analogues

Lanreotide, octreotide and pasireotide are analogues of the hypothalamic release-inhibiting hormone somatostatin. Lanreotide and octreotide are indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with neuroendocrine (particularly carcinoid) tumours and acromegaly. Additionally, lanreotide is licensed for the treatment of thyroid tumours and octreotide is also licensed for the prevention of complications following pancreatic surgery. Lanreotide (Somatuline Autogel) is also licensed for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours of midgut, pancreatic or unknown origin where hindgut sites of origin have been excluded. Octreotide long-acting depot injection is licensed for treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumours of the midgut, or treatment where primary origin is not known but non-midgut sites of origin have been excluded. Octreotide may also be valuable in reducing vomiting in palliative care and in stopping variceal bleeding [unlicensed indication]—see also vasopressin and terlipressin acetate. Pasireotide is licensed for the treatment of Cushing’s disease when surgery has failed or is inappropriate.

    <p>Lowering raised blood pressure decreases the risk of stroke, coronary events, heart failure, and renal impairment. Advice on antihypertensive therapy in this section takes into account the recommendations of NICE clinical guidance 127 (August 2011), Hypertension—Clinical management of primary hypertension in adults.</p>
    <p>Possible causes of hypertension (e.g. renal disease, endocrine causes), contributory factors, risk factors, and the presence of any complications of hypertension, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, should be established. Patients should be given advice on lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure or cardiovascular risk; these include smoking cessation, weight reduction, reduction of excessive intake of alcohol and caffeine, reduction of dietary salt, reduction of total and saturated fat, increasing exercise, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Thresholds and targets for treatment</p>
    <p>Patients presenting with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher when measured in a clinic setting, should be offered ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (or home blood pressure monitoring if ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is unsuitable) to confirm the diagnosis and stage of hypertension.</p>
    <p>Stage 1 hypertension:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clinic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, <i>and</i> ambulatory daytime average or home blood pressure average 135/85 mmHg or higher</li>
      <li>Treat patients under 80 years who have stage 1 hypertension and target-organ damage (e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic kidney disease, hypertensive retinopathy), cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes, or a 10 year cardiovascular risk ≥20%; in the absence of these conditions, advise lifestyle changes and review annually. For patients under 40 years with stage 1 hypertension but <b>no</b> overt target-organ damage, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or diabetes, consider seeking specialist advice for evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stage 2 hypertension:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clinic blood pressure 160/100 mmHg or higher, <i>and</i> ambulatory daytime average or home blood pressure average 150/95 mmHg or higher</li>
      <li>Treat all patients who have stage 2 hypertension, regardless of age</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Severe hypertension:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clinic systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg or clinic diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg; treat promptly—see Hypertensive Crises, below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A target clinic blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is suggested for patients under 80 years; a target ambulatory or home blood pressure average (during the patient’s waking hours) of below 135/85 mmHg is suggested for patients under 80 years; see also Hypertension in the Elderly, below. A target clinic blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg should be considered for those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or diabetes in the presence of kidney, eye, or cerebrovascular disease. In some individuals it may not be possible to reduce blood pressure below the suggested targets despite the use of appropriate therapy.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Drug treatment of hypertension</p>
    <p>A single antihypertensive drug is often inadequate in the management of hypertension, and additional antihypertensive drugs are usually added in a step-wise manner until control is achieved. Unless it is necessary to lower the blood pressure urgently (see Hypertensive Crises), an interval of at least 4 weeks should be allowed to determine response; clinicians should ensure antihypertensive drugs are titrated to the optimum or maximum tolerated dose at each step of treatment. Response to drug treatment may be affected by age and ethnicity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Patients under 55 years:</b>
    </p>
    <p>Step 1</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>ACE inhibitor</b>; if not tolerated, offer an <b>angiotensin-II receptor antagonist</b>. If both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are contra-indicated or not tolerated, consider a <b>beta-blocker</b>; beta-blockers, especially when combined with a thiazide diuretic, should be avoided for the routine treatment of uncomplicated hypertension in patients with diabetes or at high risk of developing diabetes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist in combination with a <b>calcium-channel blocker</b>. If a calcium-channel blocker is not tolerated or if there is evidence of, or a high risk of, heart failure, give a <b>thiazide-related diuretic</b> (e.g. chlortalidone or indapamide). If a beta-blocker was given at Step 1, add a calcium channel blocker in preference to a thiazide-related diuretic (see Step 1)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Step 3</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist in combination with a calcium-channel blocker <i>and</i> a thiazide-related diuretic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Step 4 (resistant hypertension)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider seeking specialist advice</li>
      <li>Add low-dose <b>spironolactone</b> [unlicensed indication], <i>or</i> use high-dose thiazide related diuretic if plasma-potassium concentration above 4.5 mmol/litre</li>
      <li>Monitor renal function and electrolytes</li>
      <li>If additional diuretic therapy is contra-indicated, ineffective, or not tolerated, consider an <b>alpha-blocker</b><i>or</i> a beta-blocker</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Patients over 55 years, and patients of any age who are of African or Caribbean family origin:</b>
    </p>
    <p>Step 1</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calcium-channel blocker; if not tolerated or if there is evidence of, or a high risk of, heart failure, give a thiazide-related diuretic (e.g. chlortalidone or indapamide)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calcium-channel blocker <i>or</i> thiazide-related diuretic in combination with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist in combination with a calcium-channel blocker is preferred in patients of African or Caribbean family origin)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps 3 and 4</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Treat as for patients under 55 years</li>

      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">Aspirin</xref> reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction. Unduly high blood pressure must be controlled before <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> is given. Unless contra-indicated, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> is recommended for all patients with established cardiovascular disease. Use of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> in primary prevention, in those with or without diabetes, is of unproven benefit. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">Aspirin</xref> also has a role in the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.</p>
    <p> Statins are also of benefit in cardiovascular disease or in those who are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypertension in the elderly</p>
    <p>Benefit from antihypertensive therapy is evident up to at least 80 years of age, but it is probably inappropriate to apply a strict age limit when deciding on drug therapy. Patients who reach 80 years of age while taking antihypertensive drugs should continue treatment, provided that it continues to be of benefit and does not cause significant side-effects. If patients are aged over 80 years when diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension, the decision to treat should be based on the presence of other comorbidities; patients with stage 2 hypertension should be treated as for patients over 55 years. A target clinic blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg is suggested for patients over 80 years; the suggested target ambulatory or home blood pressure average (during the patient’s waking hours) is below 145/85 mmHg.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Isolated systolic hypertension</p>
    <p>Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic pressure ≥160 mmHg, diastolic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg) is common in patients over 60 years, and is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk; it should be treated as for patients with both a raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Patients with severe postural hypotension should be referred to a specialist.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypertension in diabetes</p>
    <p>For patients with diabetes, a target clinic blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg is suggested (below 130/80 mmHg is advised if kidney, eye, or cerebrovascular disease are also present). However, in some individuals, it may not be possible to achieve this level of control despite appropriate therapy. Most patients require a combination of antihypertensive drugs.</p>
    <p>Hypertension is common in type 2 diabetes, and antihypertensive treatment prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension usually indicates the presence of diabetic nephropathy. An ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) may have a specific role in the management of diabetic nephropathy; in patients with type 2 diabetes, an ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) can delay progression of microalbuminuria to nephropathy.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypertension in renal disease</p>
    <p>A target clinic blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is suggested (below 130/80 mmHg is advised in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, or if proteinuria exceeds 1 g in 24 hours). An ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) should be considered for patients with proteinuria; however, ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in renal impairment. Thiazide diuretics may be ineffective and high doses of loop diuretics may be required.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypertension in pregnancy</p>
    <p>Hypertensive complications in pregnancy can be hazardous for both the mother and the fetus, and are associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality; complications can occur in pregnant women with pre-existing chronic hypertension, or in those who develop hypertension in the latter half of pregnancy.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/labetalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP989\">Labetalol hydrochloride</xref> is widely used for treating hypertension in pregnancy. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methyldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1077\">Methyldopa</xref> is considered safe for use in pregnancy. Modified-release preparations of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/nifedipine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1353\">nifedipine</xref> [unlicensed] are also used.</p>
    <p>The following advice takes into account the recommendations of NICE Clinical Guideline 107 (August 2010), Hypertension in Pregnancy.</p>
    <p>Pregnant women with chronic hypertension who are already receiving antihypertensive treatment should have their drug therapy reviewed. In uncomplicated chronic hypertension, a target blood pressure of &lt;150/100 mmHg is recommended; women with target-organ damage as a result of chronic hypertension, and in women with chronic hypertension who have given birth, a target blood pressure of &lt;140/90 mmHg is advised. Long-term antihypertensive treatment should be reviewed 2 weeks following the birth. Women managed with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methyldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1077\">methyldopa</xref> during pregnancy should discontinue treatment and restart their original antihypertensive medication within 2 days of the birth.</p>
    <p>Pregnant women are at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia if they have chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, chronic hypertension, or if they have had hypertension during a previous pregnancy; these women are advised to take <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> once daily [unlicensed indication] from week 12 of pregnancy until the baby is born. Women with more than one moderate risk factor (first pregnancy, aged ≥40 years, pregnancy interval &gt;10 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at first visit, multiple pregnancy, or family history of pre-eclampsia) for developing pre-eclampsia are also advised to take aspirin once daily [unlicensed indication] from week 12 of pregnancy until the baby is born.</p>
    <p>Women with pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension who present with a blood pressure over 150/100 mmHg, should receive initial treatment with oral <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/labetalol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP989\">labetalol hydrochloride</xref> to achieve a target blood pressure of &lt;150 mmHg systolic, and diastolic 80–100 mmHg.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypertensive crises</p>
    <p>If blood pressure is reduced too quickly in the management of hypertensive crises, there is a risk of reduced organ perfusion leading to cerebral infarction, blindness, deterioration in renal function, and myocardial ischaemia.</p>
    <p>A <i>hypertensive emergency</i> is defined as severe hypertension with acute damage to the target organs (e.g. signs of papilloedema or retinal haemorrhage, or the presence of clinical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes, acute aortic dissection, acute pulmonary oedema, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute cerebral infarction, intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage, eclampsia, or rapidly progressing renal failure); prompt treatment with intravenous antihypertensive therapy is generally required.

Clinic blood pressure 160/100 mmHg or higher, and ambulatory daytime average or home blood pressure average 150/95 mmHg or higherTreat all patients who have stage 2 hypertension, regardless of ageSevere hypertension:

Clinic systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg or clinic diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg; treat promptly—see Hypertensive Crises, below.A target clinic blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is suggested for patients under 80 years; a target ambulatory or home blood pressure average (during the patient’s waking hours) of below 135/85 mmHg is suggested for patients under 80 years; see also Hypertension in the Elderly, below. A target clinic blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg should be considered for those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or diabetes in the presence of kidney, eye, or cerebrovascular disease. In some individuals it may not be possible to reduce blood pressure below the suggested targets despite the use of appropriate therapy.

Drug treatment of hypertension

A single antihypertensive drug is often inadequate in the management of hypertension, and additional antihypertensive drugs are usually added in a step-wise manner until control is achieved. Unless it is necessary to lower the blood pressure urgently (see Hypertensive Crises), an interval of at least 4 weeks should be allowed to determine response; clinicians should ensure antihypertensive drugs are titrated to the optimum or maximum tolerated dose at each step of treatment. Response to drug treatment may be affected by age and ethnicity.

Patients under 55 years:

Step 1

ACE inhibitor; if not tolerated, offer an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. If both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are contra-indicated or not tolerated, consider a beta-blocker; beta-blockers, especially when combined with a thiazide diuretic, should be avoided for the routine treatment of uncomplicated hypertension in patients with diabetes or at high risk of developing diabetesStep 2

ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist in combination with a calcium-channel blocker. If a calcium-channel blocker is not tolerated or if there is evidence of, or a high risk of, heart failure, give a thiazide-related diuretic (e.g. chlortalidone or indapamide). If a beta-blocker was given at Step 1, add a calcium channel blocker in preference to a thiazide-related diuretic (see Step 1)Step 3

ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist in combination with a calcium-channel blocker and a thiazide-related diureticStep 4 (resistant hypertension)

Consider seeking specialist adviceAdd low-dose spironolactone [unlicensed indication], or use high-dose thiazide related diuretic if plasma-potassium concentration above 4.5 mmol/litreMonitor renal function and electrolytesIf additional diuretic therapy is contra-indicated, ineffective, or not tolerated, consider an alpha-blockeror a beta-blockerPatients over 55 years, and patients of any age who are of African or Caribbean family origin:

Step 1

Calcium-channel blocker; if not tolerated or if there is evidence of, or a high risk of, heart failure, give a thiazide-related diuretic (e.g. chlortalidone or indapamide)Step 2

Calcium-channel blocker or thiazide-related diuretic in combination with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist in combination with a calcium-channel blocker is preferred in patients of African or Caribbean family origin)Steps 3 and 4

Treat as for patients under 55 yearsOther measures to reduce cardiovascular risk

Aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction. Unduly high blood pressure must be controlled before aspirin is given. Unless contra-indicated, aspirin is recommended for all patients with established cardiovascular disease. Use of aspirin in primary prevention, in those with or without diabetes, is of unproven benefit. Aspirin also has a role in the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

 Statins are also of benefit in cardiovascular disease or in those who are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

Hypertension in the elderly

Benefit from antihypertensive therapy is evident up to at least 80 years of age, but it is probably inappropriate to apply a strict age limit when deciding on drug therapy. Patients who reach 80 years of age while taking antihypertensive drugs should continue treatment, provided that it continues to be of benefit and does not cause significant side-effects. If patients are aged over 80 years when diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension, the decision to treat should be based on the presence of other comorbidities; patients with stage 2 hypertension should be treated as for patients over 55 years. A target clinic blood pressure below 150/90 mmHg is suggested for patients over 80 years; the suggested target ambulatory or home blood pressure average (during the patient’s waking hours) is below 145/85 mmHg.

Isolated systolic hypertension

Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic pressure ≥160 mmHg, diastolic pressure < 90 mmHg) is common in patients over 60 years, and is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk; it should be treated as for patients with both a raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Patients with severe postural hypotension should be referred to a specialist.

Hypertension in diabetes

For patients with diabetes, a target clinic blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg is suggested (below 130/80 mmHg is advised if kidney, eye, or cerebrovascular disease are also present). However, in some individuals, it may not be possible to achieve this level of control despite appropriate therapy. Most patients require a combination of antihypertensive drugs.

Hypertension is common in type 2 diabetes, and antihypertensive treatment prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension usually indicates the presence of diabetic nephropathy. An ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) may have a specific role in the management of diabetic nephropathy; in patients with type 2 diabetes, an ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) can delay progression of microalbuminuria to nephropathy.

Hypertension in renal disease

A target clinic blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is suggested (below 130/80 mmHg is advised in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, or if proteinuria exceeds 1 g in 24 hours). An ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) should be considered for patients with proteinuria; however, ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in renal impairment. Thiazide diuretics may be ineffective and high doses of loop diuretics may be required.

Hypertension in pregnancy

Hypertensive complications in pregnancy can be hazardous for both the mother and the fetus, and are associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality; complications can occur in pregnant women with pre-existing chronic hypertension, or in those who develop hypertension in the latter half of pregnancy.

Labetalol hydrochloride is widely used for treating hypertension in pregnancy. Methyldopa is considered safe for use in pregnancy. Modified-release preparations of nifedipine [unlicensed] are also used.

The following advice takes into account the recommendations of NICE Clinical Guideline 107 (August 2010), Hypertension in Pregnancy.

Pregnant women with chronic hypertension who are already receiving antihypertensive treatment should have their drug therapy reviewed. In uncomplicated chronic hypertension, a target blood pressure of <150/100 mmHg is recommended; women with target-organ damage as a result of chronic hypertension, and in women with chronic hypertension who have given birth, a target blood pressure of <140/90 mmHg is advised. Long-term antihypertensive treatment should be reviewed 2 weeks following the birth. Women managed with methyldopa during pregnancy should discontinue treatment and restart their original antihypertensive medication within 2 days of the birth.

Pregnant women are at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia if they have chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, chronic hypertension, or if they have had hypertension during a previous pregnancy; these women are advised to take aspirin once daily [unlicensed indication] from week 12 of pregnancy until the baby is born. Women with more than one moderate risk factor (first pregnancy, aged ≥40 years, pregnancy interval >10 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 at first visit, multiple pregnancy, or family history of pre-eclampsia) for developing pre-eclampsia are also advised to take aspirin once daily [unlicensed indication] from week 12 of pregnancy until the baby is born.

Women with pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension who present with a blood pressure over 150/100 mmHg, should receive initial treatment with oral labetalol hydrochloride to achieve a target blood pressure of <150 mmHg systolic, and diastolic 80–100 mmHg. If labetalol hydrochloride is unsuitable, methyldopa or modified-release nifedipine may be considered. Women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia who have been managed with methyldopa during pregnancy should discontinue treatment within 2 days of the birth. Women with a blood pressure of ≥160/110 mmHg who require critical care during pregnancy or after birth should receive immediate treatment with either oral or intravenous labetalol hydrochloride, intravenous hydralazine hydrochloride, or oral modified-release nifedipine to achieve a target blood pressure of <150 mmHg systolic, and diastolic 80–100 mmHg.

Also see use of magnesium sulfate in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

Hypertensive crises

If blood pressure is reduced too quickly in the management of hypertensive crises, there is a risk of reduced organ perfusion leading to cerebral infarction, blindness, deterioration in renal function, and myocardial ischaemia.

A hypertensive emergency is defined as severe hypertension with acute damage to the target organs (e.g. signs of papilloedema or retinal haemorrhage, or the presence of clinical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes, acute aortic dissection, acute pulmonary oedema, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute cerebral infarction, intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage, eclampsia, or rapidly progressing renal failure); prompt treatment with intravenous antihypertensive therapy is generally required. Over the first few minutes or within 2 hours, blood pressure should be reduced by 20–25%. When intravenous therapy is indicated, treatment options include sodium nitroprusside [unlicensed], nicardipine hydrochloride, labetalol hydrochloride, glyceryl trinitrate, phentolamine mesilate, hydralazine hydrochloride, or esmolol hydrochloride; choice of drug is dependent on concomitant conditions and clinical status of the patient.

Severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 180/110 mmHg) without acute target-organ damage is defined as a hypertensive urgency; blood pressure should be reduced gradually over 24–48 hours with oral antihypertensive therapy, such as labetalol hydrochloride, or the calcium-channel blockers amlodipine or felodipine. Use of sublingual nifedipine is not recommended.

Also see advice on short-term management of hypertensive episodes in phaeochromocytoma.

Phaeochromocytoma

Long-term management of phaeochromocytoma involves surgery. However, surgery should not take place until there is adequate blockade of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors; the optimal choice of drug therapy remains unclear. Alpha-blockers are used in the short-term management of hypertensive episodes in phaeochromocytoma. Once alpha blockade is established, tachycardia can be controlled by the cautious addition of a beta-blocker; a cardioselective beta-blocker is preferred.

Phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride, a powerful alpha-blocker, is effective in the management of phaeochromocytoma but it has many side-effects. Phentolamine mesilate is a short-acting alpha-blocker used mainly during surgery of phaeochromocytoma; its use for the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma has been superseded by measurement of catecholamines in blood and urine.

Metirosine (available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) inhibits the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, and hence the synthesis of catecholamines. It is rarely used in the pre-operative management of phaeochromocytoma, and long term in patients unsuitable for surgery; an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drug may also be required. Metirosine should not be used to treat essential hypertension.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Most anxiolytics (‘sedatives’) will induce sleep when given at night and most hypnotics will sedate when given during the day. Prescribing of these drugs is widespread but dependence (both physical and psychological) and tolerance occur. This may lead to difficulty in withdrawing the drug after the patient has been taking it regularly for more than a few weeks. Hypnotics and anxiolytics should therefore be reserved for short courses to alleviate acute conditions after causal factors have been established.</p>
    <p>Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used anxiolytics and hypnotics; they act at benzodiazepine receptors which are associated with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Older drugs such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/meprobamate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2180\">meprobamate</xref> and barbiturates are <b>not</b> recommended—they have more side-effects and interactions than benzodiazepines and are much more dangerous in overdosage.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Benzodiazepine indications</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Benzodiazepines are indicated for the short-term relief (two to four weeks only) of anxiety that is severe, disabling, or causing the patient unacceptable distress, occurring alone or in association with insomnia or short-term psychosomatic, organic, or psychotic illness.</li>
        <li>The use of benzodiazepines to treat short-term ‘mild’ anxiety is inappropriate.</li>
        <li>Benzodiazepines should be used to treat insomnia only when it is severe, disabling, or causing the patient extreme distress.</li>
      </ol>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Dependence and withdrawal</p>
    <p>Withdrawal of a benzodiazepine should be gradual because abrupt withdrawal may produce confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens.</p>
    <p>The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may develop at any time up to 3 weeks after stopping a long-acting benzodiazepine, but may occur within a day in the case of a short-acting one. It is characterised by insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite and of body-weight, tremor, perspiration, tinnitus, and perceptual disturbances. Some symptoms may be similar to the original complaint and encourage further prescribing; some symptoms may continue for weeks or months after stopping benzodiazepines.</p>
    <p>Benzodiazepine withdrawal should be flexible and carried out at a reduction rate that is tolerable for the patient. The rate should depend on the initial dose of benzodiazepine, duration of use, and the patient’s clinical response. Short-term users of benzodiazepines (2–4 weeks only) can usually taper off within 2–4 weeks. However, long-term users should be withdrawn over a much longer period of several months or more.</p>
    <p>A suggested protocol for withdrawal for prescribed long-term benzodiazepine patients is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Transfer patient stepwise, one dose at a time over about a week, to an equivalent daily dose of diazepam preferably taken at night.</li>
      <li>Reduce diazepam dose, usually by 1–2 mg every 2– 4 weeks (in patients taking high doses of benzodiazepines, initially it may be appropriate to reduce the dose by up to one-tenth every 1–2 weeks). If uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms occur, maintain this dose until symptoms lessen.</li>
      <li>Reduce diazepam dose further, if necessary in smaller steps; steps of 500 micrograms may be appropriate towards the end of withdrawal. Then stop completely.</li>
      <li>For long-term patients, the period needed for complete withdrawal may vary from several months to a year or more.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Approximate equivalent doses, diazepam 5 mg</p>
    <p>≡ alprazolam 250 micrograms</p>
    <p>≡ clobazam 10 mg</p>
    <p>≡ clonazepam 250 micrograms</p>
    <p>≡ flurazepam 7.5–15 mg</p>
    <p>≡ chlordiazepoxide 12.5 mg</p>
    <p>≡ loprazolam 0.5–1 mg</p>
    <p>≡ lorazepam 500 micrograms</p>
    <p>≡ lormetazepam 0.5–1 mg</p>
    <p>≡ nitrazepam 5 mg</p>
    <p>≡ oxazepam 10 mg</p>
    <p>≡ temazepam 10 mg</p>
    <p>Withdrawal symptoms for long-term users usually resolve within 6–18 months of the last dose. Some patients will recover more quickly, others may take longer. The addition of beta-blockers, antidepressants and antipsychotics should be <b>avoided</b> where possible.</p>
    <p>Counselling can be of considerable help both during and after the taper.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypnotics</p>
    <p>Before a hypnotic is prescribed the cause of the insomnia should be established and, where possible, underlying factors should be treated. However, it should be noted that some patients have unrealistic sleep expectations, and others understate their alcohol consumption which is often the cause of the insomnia. Short-acting hypnotics are preferable in patients with sleep onset insomnia, when sedation the following day is undesirable, or when prescribing for elderly patients. Long-acting hypnotics are indicated in patients with poor sleep maintenance (e.g. early morning waking) that causes daytime effects, when an anxiolytic effect is needed during the day, or when sedation the following day is acceptable.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Transient insomnia</i> may occur in those who normally sleep well and may be due to extraneous factors such as noise, shift work, and jet lag. If a hypnotic is indicated one that is rapidly eliminated should be chosen, and only one or two doses should be given.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Short-term insomnia</i> is usually related to an emotional problem or serious medical illness. It may last for a few weeks and may recur; a hypnotic can be useful but should not be given for more than three weeks (preferably only one week). Intermittent use is desirable with omission of some doses. A short-acting drug is usually appropriate.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Chronic insomnia</i> is rarely benefited by hypnotics and is sometimes due to mild dependence caused by injudicious prescribing of hypnotics. Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and abuse of drugs and alcohol are common causes. Sleep disturbance is very common in depressive illness and early wakening is often a useful pointer. The underlying psychiatric complaint should be treated, adapting the drug regimen to alleviate insomnia.

Most anxiolytics (‘sedatives’) will induce sleep when given at night and most hypnotics will sedate when given during the day. Prescribing of these drugs is widespread but dependence (both physical and psychological) and tolerance occur. This may lead to difficulty in withdrawing the drug after the patient has been taking it regularly for more than a few weeks. Hypnotics and anxiolytics should therefore be reserved for short courses to alleviate acute conditions after causal factors have been established.

Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used anxiolytics and hypnotics; they act at benzodiazepine receptors which are associated with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Older drugs such as meprobamate and barbiturates are not recommended—they have more side-effects and interactions than benzodiazepines and are much more dangerous in overdosage.

Benzodiazepine indications

Benzodiazepines are indicated for the short-term relief (two to four weeks only) of anxiety that is severe, disabling, or causing the patient unacceptable distress, occurring alone or in association with insomnia or short-term psychosomatic, organic, or psychotic illness.The use of benzodiazepines to treat short-term ‘mild’ anxiety is inappropriate.Benzodiazepines should be used to treat insomnia only when it is severe, disabling, or causing the patient extreme distress.Dependence and withdrawal

Withdrawal of a benzodiazepine should be gradual because abrupt withdrawal may produce confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens.

The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may develop at any time up to 3 weeks after stopping a long-acting benzodiazepine, but may occur within a day in the case of a short-acting one. It is characterised by insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite and of body-weight, tremor, perspiration, tinnitus, and perceptual disturbances. Some symptoms may be similar to the original complaint and encourage further prescribing; some symptoms may continue for weeks or months after stopping benzodiazepines.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal should be flexible and carried out at a reduction rate that is tolerable for the patient. The rate should depend on the initial dose of benzodiazepine, duration of use, and the patient’s clinical response. Short-term users of benzodiazepines (2–4 weeks only) can usually taper off within 2–4 weeks. However, long-term users should be withdrawn over a much longer period of several months or more.

A suggested protocol for withdrawal for prescribed long-term benzodiazepine patients is as follows:

Transfer patient stepwise, one dose at a time over about a week, to an equivalent daily dose of diazepam preferably taken at night.Reduce diazepam dose, usually by 1–2 mg every 2– 4 weeks (in patients taking high doses of benzodiazepines, initially it may be appropriate to reduce the dose by up to one-tenth every 1–2 weeks). If uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms occur, maintain this dose until symptoms lessen.Reduce diazepam dose further, if necessary in smaller steps; steps of 500 micrograms may be appropriate towards the end of withdrawal. Then stop completely.For long-term patients, the period needed for complete withdrawal may vary from several months to a year or more.Approximate equivalent doses, diazepam 5 mg

≡ alprazolam 250 micrograms

≡ clobazam 10 mg

≡ clonazepam 250 micrograms

≡ flurazepam 7.5–15 mg

≡ chlordiazepoxide 12.5 mg

≡ loprazolam 0.5–1 mg

≡ lorazepam 500 micrograms

≡ lormetazepam 0.5–1 mg

≡ nitrazepam 5 mg

≡ oxazepam 10 mg

≡ temazepam 10 mg

Withdrawal symptoms for long-term users usually resolve within 6–18 months of the last dose. Some patients will recover more quickly, others may take longer. The addition of beta-blockers, antidepressants and antipsychotics should be avoided where possible.

Counselling can be of considerable help both during and after the taper.

Hypnotics

Before a hypnotic is prescribed the cause of the insomnia should be established and, where possible, underlying factors should be treated. However, it should be noted that some patients have unrealistic sleep expectations, and others understate their alcohol consumption which is often the cause of the insomnia. Short-acting hypnotics are preferable in patients with sleep onset insomnia, when sedation the following day is undesirable, or when prescribing for elderly patients. Long-acting hypnotics are indicated in patients with poor sleep maintenance (e.g. early morning waking) that causes daytime effects, when an anxiolytic effect is needed during the day, or when sedation the following day is acceptable.

Transient insomnia may occur in those who normally sleep well and may be due to extraneous factors such as noise, shift work, and jet lag. If a hypnotic is indicated one that is rapidly eliminated should be chosen, and only one or two doses should be given.

Short-term insomnia is usually related to an emotional problem or serious medical illness. It may last for a few weeks and may recur; a hypnotic can be useful but should not be given for more than three weeks (preferably only one week). Intermittent use is desirable with omission of some doses. A short-acting drug is usually appropriate.

Chronic insomnia is rarely benefited by hypnotics and is sometimes due to mild dependence caused by injudicious prescribing of hypnotics. Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and abuse of drugs and alcohol are common causes. Sleep disturbance is very common in depressive illness and early wakening is often a useful pointer. The underlying psychiatric complaint should be treated, adapting the drug regimen to alleviate insomnia. For example, clomipramine hydrochloride or mirtazapine prescribed for depression will also help to promote sleep if taken at night. Other causes of insomnia include daytime cat-napping and physical causes such as pain, pruritus, and dyspnoea.

Hypnotics should not be prescribed indiscriminately and routine prescribing is undesirable. They should be reserved for short courses in the acutely distressed. Tolerance to their effects develops within 3 to 14 days of continuous use and long-term efficacy cannot be assured. A major drawback of long-term use is that withdrawal can cause rebound insomnia and a withdrawal syndrome.

Where prolonged administration is unavoidable hypnotics should be discontinued as soon as feasible and the patient warned that sleep may be disturbed for a few days before normal rhythm is re-established; broken sleep with vivid dreams may persist for several weeks.

Elderly

Benzodiazepines and the Z–drugs should be avoided in the elderly, because the elderly are at greater risk of becoming ataxic and confused, leading to falls and injury.

Dental patients

Some anxious patients may benefit from the use of hypnotics during dental procedures such as temazepam or diazepam. Temazepam is preferred when it is important to minimise any residual effect the following day.

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines used as hypnotics include nitrazepam and flurazepam which have a prolonged action and may give rise to residual effects on the following day; repeated doses tend to be cumulative.

Loprazolam, lormetazepam, and temazepam act for a shorter time and they have little or no hangover effect. Withdrawal phenomena are more common with the short-acting benzodiazepines.

If insomnia is associated with daytime anxiety then the use of a long-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic such as diazepam given as a single dose at night may effectively treat both symptoms.

Zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone

Zaleplon, zolpidem tartrate and zopiclone are non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (sometimes referred to as Z-drugs), but they act at the benzodiazepine receptor. They are not licensed for long-term use; dependence has been reported in a small number of patients. Zolpidem tartrate and zopiclone have a short duration of action; zaleplon is very short acting.

Chloral and derivatives

There is no convincing evidence that they are particularly useful in the elderly and their role as hypnotics is now very limited.

Clomethiazole

Clomethiazole may be a useful hypnotic for elderly patients because of its freedom from hangover but, as with all hypnotics, routine administration is undesirable and dependence occurs.

Antihistamines

Some antihistamines such as promethazine hydrochloride are on sale to the public for occasional insomnia; their prolonged duration of action can often cause drowsiness the following day. The sedative effect of antihistamines may diminish after a few days of continued treatment; antihistamines are associated with headache, psychomotor impairment and antimuscarinic effects.

Alcohol

Alcohol is a poor hypnotic because the diuretic action interferes with sleep during the latter part of the night. Alcohol also disturbs sleep patterns, and so can worsen sleep disorders.

Melatonin

Melatonin is a pineal hormone; it is licensed for the short-term treatment of insomnia in adults over 55 years.

Anxiolytics

Benzodiazepine anxiolytics can be effective in alleviating anxiety states. Although these drugs are sometimes prescribed for stress-related symptoms, unhappiness, or minor physical disease, their use in such conditions is inappropriate. Benzodiazepine anxiolytics should not be used as sole treatment for chronic anxiety, and they are not appropriate for treating depression or chronic psychosis. In bereavement, psychological adjustment may be inhibited by benzodiazepines.

Anxiolytic benzodiazepine treatment should be limited to the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. Dependence is particularly likely in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse and in patients with marked personality disorders.

Some antidepressant drugs are licensed for use in anxiety and related disorders. Some antipsychotic drugs, in low doses, are also sometimes used in severe anxiety for their sedative action, but long-term use should be avoided because of the risk of adverse effects. The use of antihistamines (e.g. hydroxyzine hydrochloride) for their sedative effect in anxiety is not appropriate.

Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs do not affect psychological symptoms of anxiety, such as worry, tension, and fear, but they do reduce autonomic symptoms, such as palpitation and tremor; they do not reduce non-autonomic symptoms, such as muscle tension. Beta-blockers are therefore indicated for patients with predominantly somatic symptoms; this, in turn, may prevent the onset of worry and fear.

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are indicated for the short-term reliefof severe anxiety; long-term use should be avoided. Diazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, and clobazam have a sustained action. Shorter-acting compounds such as lorazepam and oxazepam may be preferred in patients with hepatic impairment but they carry a greater risk of withdrawal symptoms.

In panic disorders (with or without agoraphobia) resistant to antidepressant therapy, a benzodiazepine may be used; alternatively, a benzodiazepine may be used as short-term adjunctive therapy at the start of antidepressant treatment to prevent the initial worsening of symptoms.

Diazepam or lorazepam are very occasionally administered intravenously for the control of panic attacks. This route is the most rapid but the procedure is not without risk and should be used only when alternative measures have failed. The intramuscular route has no advantage over the oral route.

Buspirone

Buspirone hydrochloride is thought to act at specific serotonin (5HT1A) receptors. Response to treatment may take up to 2 weeks. It does not alleviate the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Therefore a patient taking a benzodiazepine still needs to have the benzodiazepine withdrawn gradually; it is advisable to do this before starting buspirone hydrochloride. The dependence and abuse potential of buspirone hydrochloride is low; it is, however, licensed for short-term use only (but specialists occasionally use it for several months).

Meprobamate

Meprobamate is less effective than the benzodiazepines, more hazardous in overdosage, and can also induce dependence. It is not recommended.

Barbiturates

The intermediate-acting barbiturates have a place only in the treatment of severe intractable insomnia in patients already taking barbiturates; they should be avoided in the elderly. Intermediate-acting barbiturate preparations containing amobarbital sodium, butobarbital, and secobarbital sodium are available on a named patient basis.

The long-acting barbiturate phenobarbital is still sometimes of value in epilepsy but its use as a sedative is unjustified.

The very short-acting barbiturate thiopental sodium is used in anaesthesia.

Increased hostility and aggression after barbiturates and alcohol usually indicates intoxication.

Chronic hypoglycaemia

Diazoxide, administered by mouth, is useful in the management of patients with chronic hypoglycaemia from excess endogenous insulin secretion, either from an islet cell tumour or islet cell hyperplasia. It has no place in the management of acute hypoglycaemia.

Tetracosactide (tetracosactrin), an analogue of corticotropin (ACTH), is used to test adrenocortical function; failure of the plasma cortisol concentration to rise after administration of tetracosactide indicates adrenocortical insufficiency.

Both corticotropin and tetracosactide were formerly used as alternatives to corticosteroids in conditions such as Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis; their value was limited by the variable and unpredictable therapeutic response and by the waning of their effect with time.

Gonadotrophins

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) together, follicle-stimulating hormone alone (as in follitropin), or chorionic gonadotrophin, are used in the treatment of infertility in women with proven hypopituitarism or who have not responded to clomifene citrate, or in superovulation treatment for assisted conception (such as in vitro fertilisation).

The gonadotrophins are also occasionally used in the treatment of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and associated oligospermia. There is no justification for their use in primary gonadal failure.

Chorionic gonadotrophin has also been used in delayed puberty in the male to stimulate endogenous testosterone production, but has little advantage over testosterone.

Growth hormone

Growth hormone is used to treat deficiency of the hormone in children and in adults. In children it is used in Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, short children considered small for gestational age at birth, and short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency.

Growth hormone of human origin (HGH; somatotrophin) has been replaced by a growth hormone of human sequence, somatropin, produced using recombinant DNA technology.

Mecasermin, a human insulin-like growth factor-I (rhIGF-I), is licensed to treat growth failure in children and adolescents with severe primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency.

Hypothalamic hormones

Gonadorelin when injected intravenously in normal subjects leads to a rapid rise in plasma concentrations of both luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). It has not proved to be very helpful, however, in distinguishing hypothalamic from pituitary lesions. Gonadorelin analogues are indicated in endometriosis and infertility and in breast and prostate cancer.

Azathioprine, ciclosporin, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate have a role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

Folic acid should be given to reduce the possibility of methotrexate toxicity [unlicensed indication]. Folic acid is usually given weekly on a different day to the methotrexate; alternative regimens may be used in some settings.

Immunosuppressant therapy

Immunosuppressants are used to suppress rejection in organ transplant recipients and to treat a variety of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Solid organ transplant patients are maintained on drug regimens, which may include antiproliferative drugs (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil), calcineurin inhibitors (ciclosporin or tacrolimus), corticosteroids, or sirolimus. Choice is dependent on the type of organ, time after transplantation, and clinical condition of the patient. Specialist management is required and other immunomodulators may be used to initiate treatment or to treat rejection.

Impaired immune responsiveness

Modification of tissue reactions caused by corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants may result in the rapid spread of infection. Corticosteroids may suppress clinical signs of infection and allow diseases such as septicaemia or tuberculosis to reach an advanced stage before being recognised—important: normal immunoglobulin administration should be considered as soon as possible after measles exposure, and varicella–zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) is recommended for individuals who have significant chickenpox (varicella) exposure. Specialist advice should be sought on the use of live vaccines for those being treated with immunosuppressive drugs.

Antiproliferative immunosuppressants

Azathioprine is widely used for transplant recipients and it is also used to treat a number of auto-immune conditions, usually when corticosteroid therapy alone provides inadequate control. It is metabolised to mercaptopurine, and doses should be reduced when allopurinol is given concurrently.

Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised to mycophenolic acid which has a more selective mode of action than azathioprine.

There is evidence that compared with similar regimens incorporating azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil reduces the risk of acute rejection episodes; the risk of opportunistic infections (particularly due to tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus) and the occurrence of blood disorders such as leucopenia may be higher.

Cyclophosphamide is less commonly prescribed as an immunosuppressant.

Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants

Prednisolone is widely used in oncology. It has a marked antitumour effect in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin’s disease, and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It has a role in the palliation of symptomatic end-stage malignant disease when it may enhance appetite and produce a sense of well-being.

The corticosteroids are also powerful immunosuppressants. They are used to prevent organ transplant rejection, and in high dose to treat rejection episodes.

Ciclosporin a calcineurin inhibitor, is a potent immunosuppressant which is virtually non-myelotoxic but markedly nephrotoxic. It has an important role in organ and tissue transplantation, for prevention of graft rejection following bone marrow, kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation, and for prophylaxis and treatment of graft-versus-host disease.

Tacrolimus is also a calcineurin inhibitor. Although not chemically related to ciclosporin it has a similar mode of action and side-effects, but the incidence of neurotoxicity appears to be greater; cardiomyopathy has also been reported. Disturbance of glucose metabolism also appears to be significant.

Sirolimus is a non-calcineurin inhibiting immunosuppressant licensed for renal transplantation.

Basiliximab is used for prophylaxis of acute rejection in allogeneic renal transplantation. It is given with ciclosporin and corticosteroid immunosuppression regimens; its use should be confined to specialist centres.

Belatacept is a fusion protein and co-stimulation blocker that prevents T-cell activation; it is licensed for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults undergoing renal transplantation who are seropositive for the Epstein-Barr virus. It is used with interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction, in combination with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic acid.

Antithymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit) is licensed for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal and heart allograft recipients and for the treatment of corticosteroid-resistant allograft rejection in renal transplantation. Tolerability is increased by pretreatment with an intravenous corticosteroid and antihistamine; an antipyretic drug such as paracetamol may also be beneficial.

Reactions are theoretically possible after injection of human immunoglobulins but reports of such reactions are very rare.

Two types of human immunoglobulin preparation are available, normal immunoglobulin and disease-specific immunoglobulins.

Human immunoglobulin is a sterile preparation of concentrated antibodies (immune globulins) recovered from pooled human plasma or serum obtained from outside the UK, tested and found non-reactive for hepatitis B surface antigen and for antibodies against hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (types 1 and 2). A global shortage of human immunoglobulin and the rapidly increasing range of clinical indications for treatment with immunoglobulins has resulted in the need for a Demand Management programme in the UK, for further information consult www.ivig.nhs.uk and Clinical Guidelines for Immunoglobulin Use, www.gov.uk/dh.

Further information on the use of immunoglobulins is included in Public Health England's Immunoglobulin Handbookwww.gov.uk/phe, and in the Department of Health’s publication, Immunisation against Infectious Disease, www.gov.uk/dh.

Availability

Normal immunoglobulin for intramuscular administration is available from some regional Public Health laboratories for protection of contacts and the control of outbreaks of hepatitis A, measles, and rubella only. For other indications, subcutaneous or intravenous normal immunoglobulin should be purchased from the manufacturer.

Disease-specific immunoglobulins are available from some regional Public Health laboratories, with the exception of tetanus immunoglobulin which is available from BPL, hospital pharmacies, or blood transfusion departments. Rabies immunoglobulin is available from the Specialist and Reference Microbiology Division, Public Health England, Colindale. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin required by transplant centres should be obtained commercially.

In Scotland all immunoglobulins are available from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS).

In Wales all immunoglobulins are available from the Welsh Blood Service (WBS).

In Northern Ireland all immunoglobulins are available from the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (NIBTS).

Normal immunoglobulin

Human normal immunoglobulin (‘HNIG’) is prepared from pools of at least 1000 donations of human plasma; it contains immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antibodies to hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and other viruses that are currently prevalent in the general population.

Uses

Normal immunoglobulin (containing 10%–18% protein) is administered by intramuscular injection for the protection of susceptible contacts against hepatitis A virus (infectious hepatitis), measles and, to a lesser extent, rubella. Injection of immunoglobulin produces immediate protection lasting several weeks.

Normal immunoglobulin (containing 3%–12% protein) for intravenous administration is used as replacement therapy for patients with congenital agammaglobulinaemia and hypogammaglobulinaemia, and for the short-term treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Kawasaki disease; it is also used for the prophylaxis of infection following bone-marrow transplantation and in children with symptomatic HIV infection who have recurrent bacterial infections. Normal immunoglobulin for replacement therapy may also be given intramuscularly or subcutaneously, but intravenous formulations are normally preferred. Intravenous immunoglobulin is also used in the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome as an alternative to plasma exchange.

For guidance on the use of intravenous normal immunoglobulin and alternative therapies for certain conditions, consult Clinical Guidelines for Immunoglobulin Use (www.gov.uk/dh).

Hepatitis A

Hepatitis A vaccine is preferred for individuals at risk of infection including those visiting areas where the disease is highly endemic (all countries excluding Northern and Western Europe,North America, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand). In unimmunised individuals, transmission of hepatitis A is reduced by good hygiene. Intramuscular normal immunoglobulin is no longer recommended for routine prophylaxis in travellers, but it may be indicated for immunocompromised patients if their antibody response to the vaccine is unlikely to be adequate.

Intramuscular normal immunoglobulin is recommended for prevention of infection in close contacts (of confirmed cases of hepatitis A) who have chronic liver disease or HIV infection, or who are immunosuppressed or over 50 years of age; normal immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible, preferably within 14 days of exposure to the primary case. However, normal immunoglobulin can still be given to contacts at risk of severe disease up to 28 days after exposure to the primary case. Hepatitis A vaccine can be given at the same time, but it should be given at a separate injection site.

Measles

Intravenous or subcutaneous normal immunoglobulin may be given to prevent or attenuate an attack of measles in individuals who do not have adequate immunity. Patients with compromised immunity who have come into contact with measles should receive intravenous or subcutaneous normal immunoglobulin as soon as possible after exposure. It is most effective if given within 72 hours but can be effective if given within 6 days.

Subcutaneous or intramuscular normal immunoglobulin should also be considered for the following individuals if they have been in contact with a confirmed case of measles or with a person associated with a local outbreak:

non-immune pregnant womeninfants under 9 monthsFurther advice should be sought from the Centre for Infections, Public Health England (tel. (020) 8200 6868).

Individuals with normal immunity who are not in the above categories and who have not been fully immunised against measles, can be given measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live for prophylaxis following exposure to measles.

Rubella

Intramuscular immunoglobulin after exposure to rubella does not prevent infection in non-immune contacts and is not recommended for protection of pregnant women exposed to rubella. It may, however, reduce the likelihood of a clinical attack which may possibly reduce the risk to the fetus. Risk of intrauterine transmission is greatest in the first 11 weeks of pregnancy, between 16 and 20 weeks there is minimal risk of deafness only, after 20 weeks there is no increased risk. Intramuscular normal immunoglobulin should be used only if termination of pregnancy would be unacceptable to the pregnant woman—it should be given as soon as possible after exposure. Serological follow-up of recipients is essential to determine if the woman has become infected despite receiving immunoglobulin.

For routine prophylaxis against Rubella, see measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live.

Disease-specific immunoglobulins

Specific immunoglobulins are prepared by pooling the plasma of selected human donors with high levels of the specific antibody required. For further information, see Immunoglobulin Handbook (www.gov.uk/phe).

There are no specific immunoglobulins for hepatitis A, measles, or rubella—normal immunoglobulin is used in certain circumstances. There is no specific immunoglobulin for mumps; neither normal immunoglobulin nor measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live is effective as post-exposure prophylaxis.

Hepatitis B immunoglobulin

Disease-specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin (‘HBIG’) is available for use in association with hepatitis B vaccine for the prevention of infection in laboratory and other personnel who have been accidentally inoculated with hepatitis B virus, and in infants born to mothers who have become infected with this virus in pregnancy or who are high-risk carriers. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin will not inhibit the antibody response when given at the same time as hepatitis B vaccine but should be given at different sites.

An intravenous and subcutaneous preparation of hepatitis B immunoglobulin is licensed for the prevention of hepatitis B recurrence in HBV-DNA negative patients who have undergone liver transplantation for liver failure caused by the virus.

Rabies immunoglobulin

Following exposure of an unimmunised individual to an animal in or from a country where the risk of rabies is high the site of the bite should be washed with soapy water and specific rabies immunoglobulin of human origin administered. All of the dose should be injected around the site of the wound; if this is difficult or the wound has completely healed it can be given in the anterolateral thigh (remote from the site used for vaccination).

Rabies vaccine should also be given intramuscularly at a different site (for details see rabies vaccine). If there is delay in giving the rabies immunoglobulin, it should be given within 7 days of starting the course of rabies vaccine.

Tetanus immunoglobulin

For the management of tetanus-prone wounds, tetanus immunoglobulin should be used in addition to wound cleansing and, where appropriate, antibacterial prophylaxis and a tetanus-containing vaccine. Tetanus immunoglobulin, together with metronidazole and wound cleansing, should also be used for the treatment of established cases of tetanus.

Varicella–zoster immunoglobulin

Varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) is recommended for individuals who are at increased risk of severe varicella and who have no antibodies to varicella– zoster virus and who have significant exposure to chickenpox or herpes zoster. Those at increased risk include:

neonates whose mothers develop chickenpox in the period 7 days before to 7 days after delivery;susceptible neonates exposed in the first 7 days of life;susceptible neonates or infants exposed whilst requiring intensive or prolonged special care nursing;susceptible women exposed at any stage of pregnancy (but when supplies of VZIG are short, may only be issued to those exposed in the first 20 weeks’ gestation or to those near term) providing VZIG is given within 10 days of contact;immunocompromised individuals including those who have received corticosteroids in the previous 3 months at the following dose equivalents of prednisolone; children 2 mg/kg daily for at least 1 week or 1 mg/kg daily for 1 month; adults about 40 mg daily for more than 1 week.Important: for full details consult Immunisation against Infectious Disease. Varicella-zoster vaccine is available.

Anti-D (Rh0) immunoglobulin

Anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin is prepared from plasma taken from rhesus-negative donors who have been immunised against the anti-D-antigen. Anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin is used to prevent a rhesus-negative mother from forming antibodies to fetal rhesus-positive cells which may pass into the maternal circulation. The objective is to protect any subsequent child from the hazard of haemolytic disease of the newborn.

Anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin should be administered to the mother following any sensitising episode (e.g. abortion, miscarriage and birth); it should be injected within 72 hours of the episode but even if a longer period has elapsed it may still give protection and should be administered. Anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin is also given when significant feto-maternal haemorrhage occurs in rhesus-negative women during delivery. The dose of anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin is determined according to the level of exposure to rhesus-positive blood.

Use of routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis should be given irrespective of previous anti-D prophylaxis for a sensitising event early in the same pregnancy. Similarly, postpartum anti-D prophylaxis should be given irrespective of previous routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis or antenatal anti-D prophylaxis for a sensitising event in the same pregnancy.

Anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin is also given to women of child-bearing potential after the inadvertent transfusion of rhesus-incompatible blood components and is used for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.

MMR vaccine

Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live may be given in the postpartum period with anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin injection provided that separate syringes are used and the products are administered into different limbs. If blood is transfused, the antibody response to the vaccine may be inhibited—measure rubella antibodies after 6–8 weeks and revaccinate if necessary.

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Treatment of acute ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease</p>
      <p>Acute mild to moderate disease affecting the rectum (proctitis) or the recto-sigmoid is treated initially with local application of an aminosalicylate; alternatively, a local corticosteroid can be used but it is less effective. A combination of a local aminosalicylate and a local corticosteroid can be used for proctitis that does not respond to a local aminosalicylate alone. Foam preparations and suppositories are especially useful when patients have difficulty retaining liquid enemas.</p>
      <p>Diffuse inflammatory bowel disease or disease that does not respond to local therapy requires oral treatment. Mild disease affecting the proximal colon can be treated with an oral aminosalicylate alone; a combination of a local and an oral aminosalicylate can be used in proctitis or distal colitis. Refractory or moderate inflammatory bowel disease usually requires adjunctive use of an oral corticosteroid such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/prednisolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP519\">prednisolone</xref> for 4–8 weeks. Modified-release <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/budesonide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP512\">budesonide</xref> is licensed for Crohn’s disease affecting the ileum and the ascending colon; it causes fewer systemic side-effects than oral <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/prednisolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP519\">prednisolone</xref> but may be less effective. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/beclometasone-dipropionate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP510\">Beclometasone dipropionate</xref> by mouth is licensed as an adjunct to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mesalazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP493\">mesalazine</xref> for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, but it is not known whether it is as effective as other corticosteroids.</p>
      <p>Severe inflammatory bowel disease or disease that is not responding to an oral corticosteroid requires hospital admission and treatment with an intravenous corticosteroid (such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydrocortisone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP515\">hydrocortisone</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methylprednisolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4371\">methylprednisolone</xref>); other therapy may include intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, and possibly parenteral nutrition.

Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases include ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Effective management requires drug therapy, attention to nutrition, and in severe or chronic active disease, surgery.

Aminosalicylates (balsalazide sodium, mesalazine, olsalazine sodium, and sulfasalazine), corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide, and prednisolone), and drugs that affect the immune response are used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

Treatment of acute ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease

Acute mild to moderate disease affecting the rectum (proctitis) or the recto-sigmoid is treated initially with local application of an aminosalicylate; alternatively, a local corticosteroid can be used but it is less effective. A combination of a local aminosalicylate and a local corticosteroid can be used for proctitis that does not respond to a local aminosalicylate alone. Foam preparations and suppositories are especially useful when patients have difficulty retaining liquid enemas.

Diffuse inflammatory bowel disease or disease that does not respond to local therapy requires oral treatment. Mild disease affecting the proximal colon can be treated with an oral aminosalicylate alone; a combination of a local and an oral aminosalicylate can be used in proctitis or distal colitis. Refractory or moderate inflammatory bowel disease usually requires adjunctive use of an oral corticosteroid such as prednisolone for 4–8 weeks. Modified-release budesonide is licensed for Crohn’s disease affecting the ileum and the ascending colon; it causes fewer systemic side-effects than oral prednisolone but may be less effective. Beclometasone dipropionate by mouth is licensed as an adjunct to mesalazine for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, but it is not known whether it is as effective as other corticosteroids.

Severe inflammatory bowel disease or disease that is not responding to an oral corticosteroid requires hospital admission and treatment with an intravenous corticosteroid (such as hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone); other therapy may include intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, and possibly parenteral nutrition. Specialist supervision is required for patients who fail to respond adequately to these measures. Patients with severe ulcerative colitis that has not responded to intravenous corticosteroids, may benefit from a short course of intravenous ciclosporin [unlicensed indication]. Patients with unresponsive or chronically active Crohn’s disease may benefit from azathioprine, mercaptopurine [unlicensed indication], or once-weekly methotrexate [unlicensed indication]; these drugs have a slower onset of action.

Infliximab is licensed for the management of severe active Crohn’s disease and severe ulcerative colitis in patients whose condition has not responded adequately to treatment with a corticosteroid and a conventional drug that affects the immune response, or who are intolerant of them.

Adalimumab is licensed for the treatment of severe active Crohn’s disease and severe ulcerative colitis in patients whose condition has not responded adequately to treatment with a corticosteroid and a conventional drug that affects the immune response, or who are intolerant of them. For inducing remission, adalimumab can be used in combination with a corticosteroid, but it may be given alone if a corticosteroid is inappropriate or is not tolerated. Adalimumab may also be used for Crohn’s disease in patients who have relapsed while taking infliximab or who cannot tolerate infliximab because of hypersensitivity reactions.

Golimumab is licensed for the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis in patients whose condition has not responded adequately to conventional therapy, or who are intolerant of it.

Vedolizumab is licensed for the treatment of moderate to severe active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in patients who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or are intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor.

Maintenance of remission of acute ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease

Smoking cessation reduces the risk of relapse in Crohn’s disease and should be encouraged. Aminosalicylates are efficacious in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, but there is no evidence of efficacy in the maintenance of remission of Crohn’s disease. Corticosteroids are not suitable for maintenance treatment because of their side-effects. In resistant or frequently relapsing cases either azathioprine or mercaptopurine [unlicensed indication], given under close supervision may be helpful. Methotrexate is tried in Crohn’s disease if azathioprine or mercaptopurine cannot be used [unlicensed indication]. Maintenance therapy with infliximab should be considered for patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis who respond to the initial induction course of infliximab; fixed-interval dosing is superior to intermittent dosing. Adalimumab is licensed for maintenance therapy in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Golimumab is licensed for maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis.

Fistulating Crohn’s disease

Treatment may not be necessary for simple, asymptomatic perianal fistulas. Metronidazole or ciprofloxacin can improve symptoms of fistulating Crohn’s disease but complete healing occurs rarely [unlicensed indication]. Metronidazole is usually given for 1 month but no longer than 3 months because of concerns about peripheral neuropathy. Ciprofloxacin by mouth is given twice daily. Other antibacterials should be given if specifically indicated (e.g. sepsis associated with fistulas and perianal disease) and for managing bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel. Fistulas may also require surgical exploration and local drainage.

Either azathioprine or mercaptopurine is used as a second-line treatment for fistulating Crohn’s disease and continued for maintenance [unlicensed indication]. Infliximab is used for fistulating Crohn’s disease refractory to conventional treatments; fixed-interval dosing is superior to intermittent dosing. Maintenance therapy with infliximab should be considered for patients who respond to the initial induction course of infliximab. Adalimumab can be used if there is intolerance to infliximab [unlicensed indication].

Adjunctive treatment of inflammatory bowel disease

Due attention should be paid to diet; high-fibre or low-residue diets should be used as appropriate.

Antimotility drugs such as codeine phosphate and loperamide hydrochloride, and antispasmodic drugs may precipitate paralytic ileus and megacolon in active ulcerative colitis; treatment of the inflammation is more logical. An osmotic laxative, such as a macrogol, may be required in proctitis. Diarrhoea resulting from the loss of bile-salt absorption (e.g. in terminal ileal disease or bowel resection) may improve with colestyramine, which binds bile salts.

Drugs used in chronic bowel disorders

Aminosalicylates

Sulfasalazine is a combination of 5-aminosalicylic acid (‘5-ASA’) and sulfapyridine; sulfapyridine acts only as a carrier to the colonic site of action but still causes side-effects. In the newer aminosalicylates, mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid), balsalazide sodium (a pro-drug of 5-aminosalicylic acid) and olsalazine sodium (a dimer of 5-aminosalicylic acid which cleaves in the lower bowel), the sulfonamide-related side-effects of sulfasalazine are avoided, but 5-aminosalicylic acid alone can still cause side-effects including blood disorders and lupus-like syndrome also seen with sulfasalazine.

Drugs affecting the immune response

Azathioprine, ciclosporin, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate have a role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

Folic acid should be given to reduce the possibility of methotrexate toxicity [unlicensed indication]. Folic acid is usually given once weekly on a different day to the methotrexate; alternative regimens may be used in some settings.

Cytokine modulators

Infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are monoclonal antibodies which inhibit the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor alpha. They should be used under specialist supervision. Adequate resuscitation facilities must be available when infliximab is used.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Insulins</p>
    <p>Insulin plays a key role in the regulation of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. It is a polypeptide hormone of complex structure. There are differences in the amino-acid sequence of animal insulins, human insulins and the human insulin analogues. Insulin may be extracted from pork pancreas and purified by crystallisation; it may also be extracted from beef pancreas, but beef insulins are now rarely used. Human sequence insulin may be produced semisynthetically by enzymatic modification of porcine insulin (emp) or biosynthetically by recombinant DNA technology using bacteria (crb, prb) or yeast (pyr).</p>
    <p>All insulin preparations are to a greater or lesser extent immunogenic in man but immunological resistance to insulin action is uncommon. Preparations of human sequence insulin should theoretically be less immunogenic, but no real advantage has been shown in trials.</p>
    <p>Insulin is inactivated by gastro-intestinal enzymes, and must therefore be given by injection; the subcutaneous route is ideal in most circumstances. Insulin is usually injected into the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen; absorption from a limb site may be increased if the limb is used in strenuous exercise after the injection. Generally subcutaneous insulin injections cause few problems; lipodystrophy may occur but can be minimised by using different injection sites in rotation. Local allergic reactions are rare.</p>
    <p>Insulin is needed by all patients with ketoacidosis, and it is likely to be needed by most patients with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>rapid onset of symptoms;</li>
      <li>substantial loss of weight;</li>
      <li>weakness;</li>
      <li>ketonuria;</li>
      <li>a first-degree relative who has type 1 diabetes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Insulin is also needed for type 2 diabetes when other methods have failed to achieve good control, and temporarily in the presence of intercurrent illness or peri-operatively. Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes may be treated with insulin when diet alone fails. Antidiabetic drugs have a role in the management of diabetes in pregnancy.</p>

    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Management of diabetes with insulin</p>
      <p>The aim of treatment is to achieve the best possible control of blood-glucose concentration without making the patient obsessional and to avoid disabling hypoglycaemia; close co-operation is needed between the patient and the medical team because good control reduces the risk of complications.</p>
      <p>Insulin preparations can be divided into 3 types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>those of <b>short</b> duration which have a relatively rapid onset of action, namely soluble insulin and the rapid-acting insulin analogues, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-aspart.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4060\">insulin aspart</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-glulisine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4062\">insulin glulisine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-lispro.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4064\">insulin lispro</xref>;</li>
        <li>those with an <b>intermediate</b> action, e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isophane-insulin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4079\">isophane insulin</xref>; and</li>
        <li>those whose action is slower in onset and lasts for <b>long</b> periods, e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/protamine-zinc-insulin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4088\">protamine zinc insulin</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-detemir.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4070\">insulin detemir</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-glargine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4072\">insulin glargine</xref>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The duration of action of a particular type of insulin varies considerably from one patient to another, and needs to be assessed individually.</p>
      <p>Mixtures of insulin preparations may be required and appropriate combinations have to be determined for the individual patient. Treatment should be started with a short-acting insulin (e.g. soluble insulin) or a rapid-acting insulin analogue (e.g. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-aspart.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4060\">insulin aspart</xref>) given before meals with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin once or twice daily. Alternatively, for those who have difficulty with, or prefer not to use, multiple injection regimens, a mixture of premixed short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue with an intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin (most commonly in a proportion of 30% soluble insulin and 70% <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isophane-insulin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4079\">isophane insulin</xref>) can be given once or twice daily. The dose of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin (or the proportion of the short-acting soluble insulin component in premixed insulin) can be increased in those with excessive postprandial hyperglycaemia. The dose of insulin is increased gradually according to the patient’s individual requirements, taking care to avoid troublesome hypoglycaemic reactions.</p>
      <p>Insulin requirements may be increased by infection, stress, accidental or surgical trauma, and during puberty. Requirements may be decreased in those with certain endocrine disorders (e.g. Addison’s disease, hypopituitarism), or in coeliac disease.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Examples of recommended insulin regimens</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple injection regimen: short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue, before meals. With intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily;</li>
        <li>Short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue mixed with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily (before meals);</li>
        <li> Intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily. With or without short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin before meals;</li>
        <li>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.</li>
      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypoglycaemia</p>
      <p>Loss of warning of hypoglycaemia among insulin-treated patients can be a serious hazard, especially for drivers and those in dangerous occupations. Very tight control of diabetes lowers the blood-glucose concentration needed to trigger hypoglycaemic symptoms; an increase in the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes may reduce the warning symptoms experienced by the patient. Beta-blockers can also blunt hypoglycaemic awareness (and also delay recovery).</p>
      <p>To restore the warning signs, episodes of hypoglycaemia must be minimised; this involves appropriate adjustment of insulin type, dose and frequency together with suitable timing and quantity of meals and snacks.</p>
      <p>Some patients have reported loss of hypoglycaemia warning after transfer to human insulin. Clinical studies do not confirm that human insulin decreases hypoglycaemia awareness. If a patient believes that human insulin is responsible for the loss of warning it is reasonable to revert to animal insulin and essential to educate the patient about avoiding hypoglycaemia. Great care should be taken to specify whether a human or an animal preparation is required.</p>
      <p>Few patients are now treated with beef insulins; when undertaking conversion from beef to human insulin, the total dose should be reduced by about 10% with careful monitoring for the first few days. When changing between pork and human-sequence insulins, a dose change is not usually needed, but careful monitoring is still advised.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Diabetes and surgery</p>
      <p>Perioperative control of blood-glucose concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes is achieved via an adjustable, continuous, intravenous infusion of insulin. Detailed local protocols should be available to all healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of these patients; in general, the following steps should be followed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>give an injection of the patient’s usual insulin on the night before the operation;</li>
        <li>early on the day of the operation, start an intravenous infusion of glucose containing potassium chloride (provided that the patient is not hyperkalaemic) and infuse at a constant rate appropriate to the patient’s fluid requirements (usually 125 mL per hour); make up a solution of soluble insulin in sodium chloride 0.9% and infuse intravenously using a syringe pump piggy-backed to the intravenous infusion. Glucose and potassium infusions, and insulin infusions should be made up according to locally agreed protocols;</li>
        <li>the rate of the insulin infusion should be adjusted according to blood-glucose concentration (frequent monitoring necessary) in line with locally agreed protocols. Other factors affecting the rate of infusion include the patient’s volume depletion, cardiac function, and age.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Protocols should include specific instructions on how to manage resistant cases (such as patients who are in shock or severely ill or those receiving corticosteroids or sympathomimetics) and those with hypoglycaemia.</p>
      <p>If a syringe pump is not available, soluble insulin should be added to the intravenous infusion of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glucose.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6004\">glucose</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/potassium-chloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5965\">potassium chloride</xref> (provided the patient is not hyperkalaemic), and the infusion run at the rate appropriate to the patient’s fluid requirements (usually 125 mL per hour) with the insulin dose adjusted according to blood-glucose concentration in line with locally agreed protocols.</p>
      <p>Once the patient starts to eat and drink, give subcutaneous insulin before breakfast and stop intravenous insulin 30 minutes later; the dose may need to be 10–20% more than usual if the patient is still in bed or unwell. If the patient was not previously receiving insulin, an appropriate initial dose is 30–40 units daily in four divided doses using soluble insulin before meals and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime and the dose adjusted from day to day. Patients with hyperglycaemia often relapse after conversion back to subcutaneous insulin calling for one of the following approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>additional doses of soluble insulin at any of the four injection times (before meals or bedtime) <i>or</i></li>
        <li>temporary addition of intravenous insulin infusion (while continuing the subcutaneous regimen) until blood-glucose concentration is satisfactory <i>or</i></li>
        <li>complete reversion to the intravenous regimen (especially if the patient is unwell).</li>
      </ul>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Short-acting insulins</p>
      <p>
        <b>Soluble insulin</b> is a short-acting form of insulin. For maintenance regimens it is usual to inject it 15 to 30 minutes before meals.</p>
      <p>Soluble insulin is the most appropriate form of insulin for use in diabetic emergencies e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis (see <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"treatment-summary/diabetic-ketoacidosis.xml\" type=\"bookmark\" rel=\"treatmentsummary\" bnfid=\"PHP78351\">Diabetic ketoacidosis</xref>) and at the time of surgery. It can be given intravenously and intramuscularly, as well as subcutaneously.</p>
      <p>When injected subcutaneously, soluble insulin has a rapid onset of action (30 to 60 minutes), a peak action between 2 and 4 hours, and a duration of action of up to 8 hours.</p>
      <p>When injected intravenously, soluble insulin has a very short half-life of only about 5 minutes and its effect disappears within 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>The rapid-acting human insulin analogues, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-aspart.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4060\">insulin aspart</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-glulisine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4062\">insulin glulisine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-lispro.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4064\">insulin lispro</xref> have a faster onset and shorter duration of action than soluble insulin; as a result, compared to soluble insulin, fasting and preprandial blood-glucose concentrations are a little higher, postprandial blood-glucose concentration is a little lower, and hypoglycaemia occurs slightly less frequently. Subcutaneous injection of insulin analogues may be convenient for those who wish to inject shortly before or, when necessary, shortly after a meal. They can also help those susceptible to hypoglycaemia before lunch and those who eat late in the evening and are prone to nocturnal hypoglycaemia. They can also be administered by subcutaneous infusion. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-aspart.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4060\">Insulin aspart</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-lispro.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4064\">insulin lispro</xref> can be administered intravenously and can be used as alternatives to soluble insulin for diabetic emergencies and at the time of surgery.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Intermediate- and long-acting insulins</p>
      <p>When given by subcutaneous injection, intermediate- and long-acting insulins have an onset of action of approximately 1–2 hours, a maximal effect at 4–12 hours, and a duration of 16–42 hours. Some are given twice daily in conjunction with short-acting (soluble) insulin, and others are given once daily, particularly in elderly patients. Soluble insulin can be mixed with intermediate and long-acting insulins (except <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-detemir.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4070\">insulin detemir</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-glargine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4072\">insulin glargine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/insulin-degludec.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP33119\">insulin degludec</xref>) in the syringe, essentially retaining the properties of the two components, although there may be some blunting of the initial effect of the soluble insulin component (especially on mixing with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/protamine-zinc-insulin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4088\">protamine zinc insulin</xref>).</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Antidiabetic drugs</p>
    <p>Oral antidiabetic drugs are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. They should be prescribed only if the patient fails to respond adequately to at least 3 months’ restriction of energy and carbohydrate intake and an increase in physical activity. They should be used to augment the effect of diet and exercise, and not to replace them.</p>
    <p>For patients not adequately controlled by diet and oral hypoglycaemic drugs, insulin may be added to the treatment regimen or substituted for oral therapy. When insulin is added to oral therapy, it is generally given at bedtime as isophane or long-acting insulin, and when insulin replaces an oral regimen it may be given as twice-daily injections of a biphasic insulin (or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isophane-insulin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4079\">isophane insulin</xref> mixed with soluble insulin), or a multiple injection regimen. Weight gain and hypoglycaemia may be complications of insulin therapy but weight gain may be reduced if the insulin is given in combination with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metformin-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4161\">metformin hydrochloride</xref>.</p>

Women with <i>gestational diabetes</i> may be treated, with or without concomitant insulin, with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glibenclamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4140\">glibenclamide</xref> from 11 weeks gestation (after organogenesis) [unlicensed use] or with metformin [unlicensed use]. Women with gestational diabetes should discontinue hypoglycaemic treatment after giving birth.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Sulfonylureas</p>
      <p>The sulfonylureas act mainly by augmenting insulin secretion and consequently are effective only when some residual pancreatic beta-cell activity is present; during long-term administration they also have an extrapancreatic action. All may cause hypoglycaemia but this is uncommon and usually indicates excessive dosage. Sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia may persist for many hours and must always be treated in hospital.</p>
      <p>Sulfonylureas are considered for patients who are not overweight, or in whom <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metformin-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4161\">metformin hydrochloride</xref> is contra-indicated or not tolerated. Several sulfonylureas are available and choice is determined by side-effects and the duration of action as well as the patient’s age and renal function. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/glibenclamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4140\">Glibenclamide</xref>, a long-acting sulfonylurea, is associated with a greater risk of hypoglycaemia; for this reason it should be avoided in the elderly, and shorter-acting alternatives, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/gliclazide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4142\">gliclazide</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tolbutamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4156\">tolbutamide</xref>, should be used instead.</p>
      <p>When the combination of strict diet and sulfonylurea treatment fails, other options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>combining with metformin;</li>
        <li>combining with pioglitazone;</li>
        <li>combining with alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, or vildagliptin;</li>

        <li>combining with exenatide, liraglutide, or lixisenatide;</li>
        <li>combining with acarbose, which may have a small beneficial effect, but flatulence can be a problem;</li>
        <li>combining with bedtime isophane insulin but weight gain and hypoglycaemia can occur.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Insulin therapy should be instituted temporarily during intercurrent illness (such as myocardial infarction, coma, infection, and trauma). Sulfonylureas should be omitted on the morning of surgery; insulin is required because of the ensuing hyperglycaemia in these circumstances.</p>

      <p>Hypoglycaemia does not usually occur with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/metformin-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4161\">metformin hydrochloride</xref>; other advantages are the lower incidence of weight gain and lower plasma-insulin concentration.

Insulin plays a key role in the regulation of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. It is a polypeptide hormone of complex structure. There are differences in the amino-acid sequence of animal insulins, human insulins and the human insulin analogues. Insulin may be extracted from pork pancreas and purified by crystallisation; it may also be extracted from beef pancreas, but beef insulins are now rarely used. Human sequence insulin may be produced semisynthetically by enzymatic modification of porcine insulin (emp) or biosynthetically by recombinant DNA technology using bacteria (crb, prb) or yeast (pyr).

All insulin preparations are to a greater or lesser extent immunogenic in man but immunological resistance to insulin action is uncommon. Preparations of human sequence insulin should theoretically be less immunogenic, but no real advantage has been shown in trials.

Insulin is inactivated by gastro-intestinal enzymes, and must therefore be given by injection; the subcutaneous route is ideal in most circumstances. Insulin is usually injected into the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen; absorption from a limb site may be increased if the limb is used in strenuous exercise after the injection. Generally subcutaneous insulin injections cause few problems; lipodystrophy may occur but can be minimised by using different injection sites in rotation. Local allergic reactions are rare.

Insulin is needed by all patients with ketoacidosis, and it is likely to be needed by most patients with:

rapid onset of symptoms;substantial loss of weight;weakness;ketonuria;a first-degree relative who has type 1 diabetes.Insulin is also needed for type 2 diabetes when other methods have failed to achieve good control, and temporarily in the presence of intercurrent illness or peri-operatively. Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes may be treated with insulin when diet alone fails. Antidiabetic drugs have a role in the management of diabetes in pregnancy.

Safe and Effective Use of Insulin in Hospitalised Patients (March 2010)

 NHS diabetes guidance available at www.diabetes.nhs.uk.

Management of diabetes with insulin

The aim of treatment is to achieve the best possible control of blood-glucose concentration without making the patient obsessional and to avoid disabling hypoglycaemia; close co-operation is needed between the patient and the medical team because good control reduces the risk of complications.

Insulin preparations can be divided into 3 types:

those of short duration which have a relatively rapid onset of action, namely soluble insulin and the rapid-acting insulin analogues, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, and insulin lispro;those with an intermediate action, e.g. isophane insulin; andthose whose action is slower in onset and lasts for long periods, e.g. protamine zinc insulin, insulin detemir, and insulin glargine.The duration of action of a particular type of insulin varies considerably from one patient to another, and needs to be assessed individually.

Mixtures of insulin preparations may be required and appropriate combinations have to be determined for the individual patient. Treatment should be started with a short-acting insulin (e.g. soluble insulin) or a rapid-acting insulin analogue (e.g. insulin aspart) given before meals with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin once or twice daily. Alternatively, for those who have difficulty with, or prefer not to use, multiple injection regimens, a mixture of premixed short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue with an intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin (most commonly in a proportion of 30% soluble insulin and 70% isophane insulin) can be given once or twice daily. The dose of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin (or the proportion of the short-acting soluble insulin component in premixed insulin) can be increased in those with excessive postprandial hyperglycaemia. The dose of insulin is increased gradually according to the patient’s individual requirements, taking care to avoid troublesome hypoglycaemic reactions.

Insulin requirements may be increased by infection, stress, accidental or surgical trauma, and during puberty. Requirements may be decreased in those with certain endocrine disorders (e.g. Addison’s disease, hypopituitarism), or in coeliac disease.

Examples of recommended insulin regimens

Multiple injection regimen: short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue, before meals. With intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily;Short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue mixed with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily (before meals); Intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin, once or twice daily. With or without short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin before meals;Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.Hypoglycaemia

Loss of warning of hypoglycaemia among insulin-treated patients can be a serious hazard, especially for drivers and those in dangerous occupations. Very tight control of diabetes lowers the blood-glucose concentration needed to trigger hypoglycaemic symptoms; an increase in the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes may reduce the warning symptoms experienced by the patient. Beta-blockers can also blunt hypoglycaemic awareness (and also delay recovery).

To restore the warning signs, episodes of hypoglycaemia must be minimised; this involves appropriate adjustment of insulin type, dose and frequency together with suitable timing and quantity of meals and snacks.

Some patients have reported loss of hypoglycaemia warning after transfer to human insulin. Clinical studies do not confirm that human insulin decreases hypoglycaemia awareness. If a patient believes that human insulin is responsible for the loss of warning it is reasonable to revert to animal insulin and essential to educate the patient about avoiding hypoglycaemia. Great care should be taken to specify whether a human or an animal preparation is required.

Few patients are now treated with beef insulins; when undertaking conversion from beef to human insulin, the total dose should be reduced by about 10% with careful monitoring for the first few days. When changing between pork and human-sequence insulins, a dose change is not usually needed, but careful monitoring is still advised.

Diabetes and surgery

Perioperative control of blood-glucose concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes is achieved via an adjustable, continuous, intravenous infusion of insulin. Detailed local protocols should be available to all healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of these patients; in general, the following steps should be followed:

give an injection of the patient’s usual insulin on the night before the operation;early on the day of the operation, start an intravenous infusion of glucose containing potassium chloride (provided that the patient is not hyperkalaemic) and infuse at a constant rate appropriate to the patient’s fluid requirements (usually 125 mL per hour); make up a solution of soluble insulin in sodium chloride 0.9% and infuse intravenously using a syringe pump piggy-backed to the intravenous infusion. Glucose and potassium infusions, and insulin infusions should be made up according to locally agreed protocols;the rate of the insulin infusion should be adjusted according to blood-glucose concentration (frequent monitoring necessary) in line with locally agreed protocols. Other factors affecting the rate of infusion include the patient’s volume depletion, cardiac function, and age.Protocols should include specific instructions on how to manage resistant cases (such as patients who are in shock or severely ill or those receiving corticosteroids or sympathomimetics) and those with hypoglycaemia.

If a syringe pump is not available, soluble insulin should be added to the intravenous infusion of glucose and potassium chloride (provided the patient is not hyperkalaemic), and the infusion run at the rate appropriate to the patient’s fluid requirements (usually 125 mL per hour) with the insulin dose adjusted according to blood-glucose concentration in line with locally agreed protocols.

Once the patient starts to eat and drink, give subcutaneous insulin before breakfast and stop intravenous insulin 30 minutes later; the dose may need to be 10–20% more than usual if the patient is still in bed or unwell. If the patient was not previously receiving insulin, an appropriate initial dose is 30–40 units daily in four divided doses using soluble insulin before meals and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime and the dose adjusted from day to day. Patients with hyperglycaemia often relapse after conversion back to subcutaneous insulin calling for one of the following approaches:

additional doses of soluble insulin at any of the four injection times (before meals or bedtime) ortemporary addition of intravenous insulin infusion (while continuing the subcutaneous regimen) until blood-glucose concentration is satisfactory orcomplete reversion to the intravenous regimen (especially if the patient is unwell).Short-acting insulins

Soluble insulin is a short-acting form of insulin. For maintenance regimens it is usual to inject it 15 to 30 minutes before meals.

Soluble insulin is the most appropriate form of insulin for use in diabetic emergencies e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis (see Diabetic ketoacidosis) and at the time of surgery. It can be given intravenously and intramuscularly, as well as subcutaneously.

When injected subcutaneously, soluble insulin has a rapid onset of action (30 to 60 minutes), a peak action between 2 and 4 hours, and a duration of action of up to 8 hours.

When injected intravenously, soluble insulin has a very short half-life of only about 5 minutes and its effect disappears within 30 minutes.

The rapid-acting human insulin analogues, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, and insulin lispro have a faster onset and shorter duration of action than soluble insulin; as a result, compared to soluble insulin, fasting and preprandial blood-glucose concentrations are a little higher, postprandial blood-glucose concentration is a little lower, and hypoglycaemia occurs slightly less frequently. Subcutaneous injection of insulin analogues may be convenient for those who wish to inject shortly before or, when necessary, shortly after a meal. They can also help those susceptible to hypoglycaemia before lunch and those who eat late in the evening and are prone to nocturnal hypoglycaemia. They can also be administered by subcutaneous infusion. Insulin aspart and insulin lispro can be administered intravenously and can be used as alternatives to soluble insulin for diabetic emergencies and at the time of surgery.

Intermediate- and long-acting insulins

When given by subcutaneous injection, intermediate- and long-acting insulins have an onset of action of approximately 1–2 hours, a maximal effect at 4–12 hours, and a duration of 16–42 hours. Some are given twice daily in conjunction with short-acting (soluble) insulin, and others are given once daily, particularly in elderly patients. Soluble insulin can be mixed with intermediate and long-acting insulins (except insulin detemir, insulin glargine, and insulin degludec) in the syringe, essentially retaining the properties of the two components, although there may be some blunting of the initial effect of the soluble insulin component (especially on mixing with protamine zinc insulin).

Isophane insulin is a suspension of insulin with protamine; it is of particular value for initiation of twice-daily insulin regimens. Patients usually mix isophane with soluble insulin but ready-mixed preparations may be appropriate (biphasic isophane insulin, biphasic insulin aspart, or biphasic insulin lispro).

Insulin zinc suspension (30% amorphous, 70% crystalline) has a more prolonged duration of action.

Protamine zinc insulin is usually given once daily with short-acting (soluble) insulin. It has the drawback of binding with the soluble insulin when mixed in the same syringe and is now rarely used.

Insulin glargine and insulin detemir are both long-acting human insulin analogues with a prolonged duration of action; insulin glargine is given once daily and insulin detemir is given once or twice daily. NICE (December 2002) has recommended that insulin glargine should be available as an option for patients with type 1 diabetes.

NICE (May 2009) has recommended that, if insulin is required in patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin detemir or insulin glargine may be considered for those:

who require assistance with injecting insulin orwhose lifestyle is significantly restricted by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemia orwho would otherwise need twice-daily basal insulin injections in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs orwho cannot use the device needed to inject isophane insulin.Insulin detemir is also licensed as add-on therapy in patients receiving treatment with liraglutide.

Insulin degludec is a long-acting human insulin analogue for once daily subcutaneous administration.

Hypodermic equipment

Patients should be advised on the safe disposal of lancets, single-use syringes, and needles. Suitable arrangements for the safe disposal of contaminated waste must be made before these products are prescribed for patients who are carriers of infectious diseases.

Lancets, needles, syringes, and accessories are listed under Hypodermic Equipment in Part IXA of the Drug Tariff (Part III of the Northern Ireland Drug Tariff, Part 3 of the Scottish Drug Tariff). The drug Tariffs can be access online at:

National Health Service Drug Tariff for England and Wales:www.ppa.org.uk/ppa/edt_intro.htm

Health and Personal Social Services for Northern Ireland Drug Tariff:www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/pas-tariff

Scottish Drug Tariff:www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Prescribing-and-Medicines/Scottish-Drug-Tariff/

Antidiabetic drugs

Oral antidiabetic drugs are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. They should be prescribed only if the patient fails to respond adequately to at least 3 months’ restriction of energy and carbohydrate intake and an increase in physical activity. They should be used to augment the effect of diet and exercise, and not to replace them.

For patients not adequately controlled by diet and oral hypoglycaemic drugs, insulin may be added to the treatment regimen or substituted for oral therapy. When insulin is added to oral therapy, it is generally given at bedtime as isophane or long-acting insulin, and when insulin replaces an oral regimen it may be given as twice-daily injections of a biphasic insulin (or isophane insulin mixed with soluble insulin), or a multiple injection regimen. Weight gain and hypoglycaemia may be complications of insulin therapy but weight gain may be reduced if the insulin is given in combination with metformin hydrochloride.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding

During pregnancy, women with pre-existing diabetes can be treated with metformin hydrochloride [unlicensed use], either alone or in combination with insulin. Metformin hydrochloride can be continued, or glibenclamide resumed, during breast-feeding for those with pre-existing diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes may be treated, with or without concomitant insulin, with glibenclamide from 11 weeks gestation (after organogenesis) [unlicensed use] or with metformin [unlicensed use]. Women with gestational diabetes should discontinue hypoglycaemic treatment after giving birth.

Sulfonylureas

The sulfonylureas act mainly by augmenting insulin secretion and consequently are effective only when some residual pancreatic beta-cell activity is present; during long-term administration they also have an extrapancreatic action. All may cause hypoglycaemia but this is uncommon and usually indicates excessive dosage. Sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia may persist for many hours and must always be treated in hospital.

Sulfonylureas are considered for patients who are not overweight, or in whom metformin hydrochloride is contra-indicated or not tolerated. Several sulfonylureas are available and choice is determined by side-effects and the duration of action as well as the patient’s age and renal function. Glibenclamide, a long-acting sulfonylurea, is associated with a greater risk of hypoglycaemia; for this reason it should be avoided in the elderly, and shorter-acting alternatives, such as gliclazide or tolbutamide, should be used instead.

When the combination of strict diet and sulfonylurea treatment fails, other options include:

combining with metformin;combining with pioglitazone;combining with alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, or vildagliptin;combining with canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin;combining with exenatide, liraglutide, or lixisenatide;combining with acarbose, which may have a small beneficial effect, but flatulence can be a problem;combining with bedtime isophane insulin but weight gain and hypoglycaemia can occur.Insulin therapy should be instituted temporarily during intercurrent illness (such as myocardial infarction, coma, infection, and trauma). Sulfonylureas should be omitted on the morning of surgery; insulin is required because of the ensuing hyperglycaemia in these circumstances.

Biguanides

Metformin hydrochloride, the only available biguanide, has a different mode of action from the sulfonylureas, and is not interchangeable with them.

Metformin hydrochloride is the drug of first choice in overweight patients in whom strict dieting has failed to control diabetes, if appropriate it may also be considered as an option in patients who are not overweight. It is also used when diabetes is inadequately controlled with sulfonylurea treatment. When the combination of strict diet and metformin hydrochloride treatment fails, other options include:

combining with a sulfonylurea;combining with pioglitazone;combining with repaglinide or nateglinide;combining with alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, or vildagliptin;combining with canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin;combining with exenatide, liraglutide, or lixisenatide;combining with acarbose, which may have a small beneficial effect, but flatulence can be a problem;combining with insulin but weight gain and hypoglycaemia can be problems (weight gain minimised if insulin given at night).Insulin treatment is almost always required in medical and surgical emergencies; insulin should also be substituted before elective surgery (omit metformin hydrochloride on the morning of surgery and give insulin if required).

Hypoglycaemia does not usually occur with metformin hydrochloride; other advantages are the lower incidence of weight gain and lower plasma-insulin concentration. It does not exert a hypoglycaemic action in non-diabetic subjects unless given in overdose.

Metformin hydrochloride is used for the symptomatic management of polycystic ovary syndrome [unlicensed indication]; however, treatment should be initiated by a specialist. Metformin hydrochloride improves insulin sensitivity, may aid weight reduction, helps to normalise menstrual cycle (increasing the rate of spontaneous ovulation), and may improve hirsutism.

Other antidiabetic drugs

Use of acarbose is usually reserved for when other oral hypoglycaemics are not tolerated or are contra-indicated. Postprandial hyperglycaemia in type 1 diabetes can be reduced by acarbose, but it has been little used for this purpose. Flatulence deters some from using acarbose although this side-effect tends to decrease with time.

Nateglinide and repaglinide stimulate insulin secretion. Both drugs have a rapid onset of action and short duration of activity, and should be administered shortly before each main meal. Repaglinide may be given as monotherapy for patients who are not overweight or for those in whom metformin hydrochloride is contra-indicated or not tolerated, or it may be given in combination with metformin hydrochloride. Nateglinide is licensed only for use with metformin hydrochloride.

Pioglitazone can be used alone or in combination with metformin hydrochloride or with a sulfonylurea (if metformin hydrochloride inappropriate), or with both; the combination of pioglitazone plus metformin hydrochloride is preferred to pioglitazone plus sulfonylurea, particularly for obese patients. Inadequate response to a combination of metformin hydrochloride and sulfonylurea may indicate failing insulin release; the introduction of pioglitazone has a limited role in these circumstances and the initiation of insulin is often more appropriate. Pioglitazone is also licensed in combination with insulin, in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control with insulin alone, when metformin hydrochloride is inappropriate. Blood-glucose control may deteriorate temporarily when pioglitazone is substituted for an oral antidiabetic drug that is being used in combination with another. Long-term benefits of pioglitazone have not yet been demonstrated. NICE (May 2009) has recommended that, when glycaemic control is inadequate with existing treatment, pioglitazone can be added to:

a sulfonylurea, if metformin hydrochloride is contra-indicated or not tolerated;metformin, if risks of hypoglycaemia with sulfonylurea are unacceptable or a sulfonylurea is contraindicated or not tolerated;a combination of metformin hydrochloride and a sulfonylurea, if insulin is unacceptable because of lifestyle or other personal issues, or because the patient is obese.NICE has recommended that treatment with pioglitazone is continued only if HbA1c concentration is reduced by at least 0.5 percentage points within 6 months of starting treatment.

Linagliptin is licensed for use in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy (if metformin hydrochloride inappropriate), or in combination with metformin hydrochloride (when treatment with metformin hydrochloride alone fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control), or both metformin hydrochloride and a sulfonylurea (when dual therapy with these drugs fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control). Linagliptin may also be used in combination with insulin (with or without metformin hydrochloride) when a stable dose of insulin has not provided adequate glycaemic control.

Saxagliptin and vildagliptin are licensed for use in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy (if metformin hydrochloride inappropriate), or in combination with metformin hydrochloride or a sulfonylurea (if metformin hydrochloride inappropriate), or pioglitazone (when treatment with either metformin hydrochloride or a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control), and also in combination with both metformin hydrochloride and a sulfonylurea (when dual therapy with these drugs fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control). The combination of either saxagliptin or vildagliptin, and insulin (with or without metformin hydrochloride) is also licensed for use when a stable dose of insulin has not provided adequate glycaemic control.

Alogliptin is also licensed for use as triple therapy in combination with metformin hydrochloride and either pioglitazone or insulin.

NICE (May 2009) has recommended that, when glycaemic control is inadequate with existing treatment:

sitagliptin or vildagliptin (instead of a sulfonylurea) can be added to metformin, if there is a significant risk of hypoglycaemia or if a sulfonylurea is contraindicated or not tolerated;sitagliptin or vildagliptin can be added to a sulfonylurea, if metformin is contra-indicated or not tolerated;sitagliptin can be added to both metformin and a sulfonylurea, if insulin is unacceptable because of lifestyle or other personal issues, or because the patient is obese.NICE has recommended that treatment with sitagliptin or vildagliptin is continued only if HbA1cconcentration is reduced by at least 0.5 percentage points within 6 months of starting treatment.

Treatment with exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide is associated with the prevention of weight gain and possible promotion of weight loss which can be beneficial in overweight patients. They are given by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Exenatide is licensed in combination with metformin hydrochloride or a sulfonylurea, or both, or with pioglitazone, or with both metformin hydrochloride and pioglitazone, in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control with these drugs alone or in combination; standard-release exenatide is also licensed in combination with basal insulin alone or with metformin hydrochloride or pioglitazone (or both).

NICE (May 2009) has recommended that, when glycaemic control is inadequate with metformin hydrochloride and sulfonylurea treatment, the addition of standard-release exenatide may be considered if the patient has:

a body mass index of 35 kg/m2 or over and is of European descent (with appropriate adjustment for other ethnic groups) and weight-related psychological or medical problems ora body mass index less than 35 kg/m2, and insulin would be unacceptable for occupational reasons or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities.NICE has recommended that treatment with standard release exenatide is continued only if HbA1c concentration is reduced by at least 1 percentage point and a weight loss of at least 3% is achieved within 6 months of starting treatment.

Liraglutide is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with metformin hydrochloride or a sulfonylurea, or both, in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control with these drugs alone or in combination. Liraglutide is also licensed for use in combination with basal insulin or both metformin hydrochloride and pioglitazone when dual therapy with these drugs fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control.

Lixisenatide is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs (e.g. metformin hydrochloride, pioglitazone, or a sulfonylurea) or basal insulin, or both, when adequate glycaemic control has not been achieved with these drugs; lixisenatide should not be used in combination with both basal insulin and a sulfonylurea because of an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.

Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin are licensed for use in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy (if metformin hydrochloride inappropriate), or in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic drugs (if existing treatment fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control). Dapagliflozin is not recommended in combination with pioglitazone.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Overview</p>
    <p>Severe tissue iron overload can occur in aplastic and other refractory anaemias, mainly as the result of repeated blood transfusions. It is a particular problem in refractory anaemias with hyperplastic bone marrow, especially <i>thalassaemia major</i>, where excessive iron absorption from the gut and inappropriate iron therapy can add to the tissue siderosis.</p>

Severe tissue iron overload can occur in aplastic and other refractory anaemias, mainly as the result of repeated blood transfusions. It is a particular problem in refractory anaemias with hyperplastic bone marrow, especially thalassaemia major, where excessive iron absorption from the gut and inappropriate iron therapy can add to the tissue siderosis.

Iron overload associated with haemochromatosis can be treated with repeated venesection. Venesection may also be used for patients who have received multiple transfusions and whose bone marrow has recovered. Where venesection is contra-indicated, the long-term administration of the iron chelating compound desferrioxamine mesilate is useful. Desferrioxamine mesilate (up to 2 g per unit of blood) may also be given at the time of blood transfusion, provided that the desferrioxamine mesilate is not added to the blood and is not given through the same line as the blood (but the two may be given through the same cannula).

Iron excretion induced by desferrioxamine mesilate is enhanced by administration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) daily by mouth; it should be given separately from food since it also enhances iron absorption. Ascorbic acid should not be given to patients with cardiac dysfunction; in patients with normal cardiac function ascorbic acid should be introduced 1 month after starting desferrioxamine mesilate.

Desferrioxamine mesilate infusion can be used to treat aluminium overload in dialysis patients; theoretically 100 mg of desferrioxamine binds with 4.1 mg of aluminium.

    <p>Preventative measures should be taken in individuals with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (primary prevention) and to prevent recurrence of events in those with established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention).</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Primary prevention</p>
    <p>Individuals at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease include those who have diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and/or albuminuria, and those with familial hypercholesterolaemia. The risk also increases with age; those aged 85 years and over are at particularly high risk, especially if they smoke or have hypertension. Preventative measures are also required for other individuals who are considered to be at high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease based on risk estimated using risk calculators (see Risk calculators); those with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more stand to benefit most from drug treatment. Patients with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of less than 10% may benefit from an assessment of their lifetime risk (using the JBS3 tool—see Risk calculators for more detail), discussion on the impact of lifestyle interventions and, if necessary, drug therapy.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Risk calculators</p>
    <p>Risk assessment calculators are recommended by both NICE (clinical guideline 181 (July 2014). Lipid Modification—Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease) and JBS3 (Joint British Societies' consensus recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease 2014).

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease</p>
    <p>A statin reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease events, and is the drug of first choice for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Before starting treatment with statins, secondary causes of dyslipidaemia should be addressed; these include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hepatic disease, nephrotic syndrome, and excessive alcohol consumption. Patients with hypothyroidism should receive adequate thyroid replacement therapy (before assessing the requirement for lipid-regulating treatment if for primary prevention) because correcting hypothyroidism itself may resolve the lipid abnormality. Untreated hypothyroidism increases the risk of myositis with lipid-regulating drugs.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of reducing cardiovascular risk, NICE Clinical Guideline 181 (NICE clinical guideline 181 (July 2014). Lipid Modification—Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease) defines statins by the percentage reduction in LDL-cholesterol they achieve:</p>
    <p>For <i>primary prevention</i>, NICE Clinical Guideline 181 recommends that <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atorvastatin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1633\">atorvastatin</xref> a high-intensity statin (when prescribed at a dose of at least 20 mg/day), should be offered to those with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more; patients aged 85 years and over may benefit from <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atorvastatin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1633\">atorvastatin</xref> to reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction. For <i>secondary prevention</i>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atorvastatin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1633\">atorvastatin</xref> is also recommended. Patients taking a low- or medium-intensity statin should discuss the benefits and risks of switching to a high intensity statin at their next medication review.</p>
    <p>A statin should be considered for <i>all</i> adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus, particularly those aged 40 years and over, or who have had diabetes for more than 10 years, or who have established nephropathy, or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. JBS3 recommendations (Joint British Societies' consensus recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (JBS3) 2014) in diabetes mellitus differ in certain respects from NICE Clinical Guideline 181(NICE clinical guideline 181 (July 2014). Lipid Modification—Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease)—see JBS3 recommendations for further details. In type 2 diabetes, assess level of risk using the risk calculator and treat for primary prevention if necessary.</p>
    <p>Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations should be checked 3 months after starting treatment with a high intensity statin. NICE Clinical Guideline 181 recommends aiming for a reduction in non-HDL cholesterol concentration greater than 40%; JBS3 recommends a target non-HDL cholesterol concentration below 2.5 mmol/litre. If these are not achieved, ensure lifestyle modifications are optimised and consider increasing the dose of the statin if started on less than atorvastatin 80 mg and the patient is judged to be at higher risk because of comorbidities, risk score or, using clinical judgement. </p>
    <p>Specialist advice should be sought about treatment options for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease or those with existing cardiovascular disease, who are intolerant of three different statins.</p>

    <p>A statin is also the drug of first choice for treating hypercholesterolaemia and moderate hypertriglyceridaemia.

    <p>A statin is recommended for all patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. A ‘high-intensity’ statin (as defined in NICE Clinical Guideline 71, August 2008.

Preventative measures should be taken in individuals with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (primary prevention) and to prevent recurrence of events in those with established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention).

Primary prevention

Individuals at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease include those who have diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2) and/or albuminuria, and those with familial hypercholesterolaemia. The risk also increases with age; those aged 85 years and over are at particularly high risk, especially if they smoke or have hypertension. Preventative measures are also required for other individuals who are considered to be at high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease based on risk estimated using risk calculators (see Risk calculators); those with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more stand to benefit most from drug treatment. Patients with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of less than 10% may benefit from an assessment of their lifetime risk (using the JBS3 tool—see Risk calculators for more detail), discussion on the impact of lifestyle interventions and, if necessary, drug therapy.

Risk calculators

Risk assessment calculators are recommended by both NICE (clinical guideline 181 (July 2014). Lipid Modification—Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease) and JBS3 (Joint British Societies' consensus recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease 2014). They should not be used in patients at high cardiovascular risk. Both calculators are unsuitable for assessing risk in those aged 85 years and over, and NICE advises against using a risk assessment tool in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

 The QRISK2 risk calculator www.qrisk.org/ is recommended by NICE clinical guideline 181, and the JBS3 risk calculatorwww.jbs3risk.com/pages/risk_calculator.htm is endorsed by JBS3. Both tools assess cardiovascular risk—coronary heart disease (angina and myocardial infarction), stroke, and transient ischaemic attack, on the basis of lipid profile, systolic blood pressure, gender, age, ethnicity, smoking status, BMI, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, treated hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Risk assessment tools underestimate risk in patients with additional risk due to existing conditions or medication, such as: 

serious mental disorderautoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and other systemic inflammatory disordersantiretroviral treatment medication causing dyslipidaemia as a side-effect e.g. antipsychotics, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressantstriglyceride concentration > 4.5 mmol/litreCardiovascular disease risk is also underestimated in those who are already taking antihypertensive or lipid-regulating drugs, and in those who have recently stopped smoking. Severe obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2) also increases cardiovascular risk; the need for further treatment of risk factors in patients below the cardiovascular risk threshold for treatment should be based on clinical judgement.

Preventative measures for primary prevention

All patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease should be advised to make lifestyle modifications that include beneficial changes to diet, exercise, weight management, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation. 

Offer a statin as first-line drug treatment if lifestyle modifications are inappropriate or ineffective (see also Statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease). Lipid-regulating drug treatment must be combined with advice on diet and lifestyle measures, and where appropriate, treatment of comorbidities and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia.

Secondary prevention

Statins should be offered to all patients, including the elderly, with cardiovascular disease such as those with coronary heart disease (including history of angina or acute myocardial infarction), occlusive arterial disease (including peripheral vascular disease, non-haemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischaemic attacks).

Preventative measures for secondary prevention

Patients should be advised to make lifestyle modifications that include beneficial changes to diet, exercise, weight management, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation, however, initiation of lipid-regulating drug treatment should not be delayed to manage modifiable risk factors, and must be combined with advice on diet and lifestyle measures, and where appropriate, treatment of comorbidities and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia.

Statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease

A statin reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease events, and is the drug of first choice for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Before starting treatment with statins, secondary causes of dyslipidaemia should be addressed; these include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hepatic disease, nephrotic syndrome, and excessive alcohol consumption. Patients with hypothyroidism should receive adequate thyroid replacement therapy (before assessing the requirement for lipid-regulating treatment if for primary prevention) because correcting hypothyroidism itself may resolve the lipid abnormality. Untreated hypothyroidism increases the risk of myositis with lipid-regulating drugs.

For the purpose of reducing cardiovascular risk, NICE Clinical Guideline 181 (NICE clinical guideline 181 (July 2014). Lipid Modification—Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease) defines statins by the percentage reduction in LDL-cholesterol they achieve:

For primary prevention, NICE Clinical Guideline 181 recommends that atorvastatin a high-intensity statin (when prescribed at a dose of at least 20 mg/day), should be offered to those with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more; patients aged 85 years and over may benefit from atorvastatin to reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction. For secondary prevention, atorvastatin is also recommended. Patients taking a low- or medium-intensity statin should discuss the benefits and risks of switching to a high intensity statin at their next medication review.

A statin should be considered for all adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus, particularly those aged 40 years and over, or who have had diabetes for more than 10 years, or who have established nephropathy, or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. JBS3 recommendations (Joint British Societies' consensus recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (JBS3) 2014) in diabetes mellitus differ in certain respects from NICE Clinical Guideline 181(NICE clinical guideline 181 (July 2014). Lipid Modification—Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease)—see JBS3 recommendations for further details. In type 2 diabetes, assess level of risk using the risk calculator and treat for primary prevention if necessary.

Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations should be checked 3 months after starting treatment with a high intensity statin. NICE Clinical Guideline 181 recommends aiming for a reduction in non-HDL cholesterol concentration greater than 40%; JBS3 recommends a target non-HDL cholesterol concentration below 2.5 mmol/litre. If these are not achieved, ensure lifestyle modifications are optimised and consider increasing the dose of the statin if started on less than atorvastatin 80 mg and the patient is judged to be at higher risk because of comorbidities, risk score or, using clinical judgement. 

Specialist advice should be sought about treatment options for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease or those with existing cardiovascular disease, who are intolerant of three different statins.

Fibrates should not be routinely used for primary or secondary prevention. Nicotinic acid, bile acid sequestrants, and omega-3 fatty acid compounds are not recommended for primary or secondary prevention.

Hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and familial hypercholesterolaemia

A statin is also the drug of first choice for treating hypercholesterolaemia and moderate hypertriglyceridaemia. Severe hyperlipidaemia not adequately controlled with a maximal dose of a statin may require the use of an additional lipid-regulating drug such as ezetimibe; such treatment should generally be supervised by a specialist.

A number of conditions, some familial, are characterised by very high LDL-cholesterol concentration, high triglyceride concentration, or both. Fenofibrate may be added to statin therapy if triglycerides remain high even after the LDL-cholesterol concentration has been reduced adequately; nicotinic acidmay also be used to further lower triglyceride or LDL-cholesterol concentration.

Combination of a statin with a fibrate or with nicotinic acid carries an increased risk of side-effects (including rhabdomyolysis) and should be used under specialist supervision; monitoring of liver function and creatine kinase should also be considered. The concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with a statin increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis considerably—this combination should not be used.

A statin is recommended for all patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. A ‘high-intensity’ statin (as defined in NICE Clinical Guideline 71, August 2008. Identification and management of familial hypercholesterolaemia) e.g.rosuvastatin (initiated by a specialist) or atorvastatin should be considered in order to achieve the recommended reduction in LDL-cholesterol concentration of greater than 50% from baseline; a ‘high-intensity’ statin is one that produces a greater LDL-cholesterol reduction than simvastatin 40 mg. Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia who have contra-indications to, or are intolerant of, statins should receive ezetimibe. The combination of a statin and ezetimibe can be considered if a statin alone fails to provide adequate control (or if intolerance limits dose titration), and when a switch to an alternative statin is being considered. Patients for whom statins and ezetimibe are inappropriate, should be referred to a specialist for the consideration of treatment with a bile acid sequestrant, nicotinic acid, or a fibrate. 

The prescribing of drug therapy in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia should be undertaken in a specialist centre.

The 80 mg dose should be considered only in patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia and high risk of cardiovascular complications who have not achieved their treatment goals on lower doses, when the benefits are expected to outweigh the potential risks.Statins

Statins are more effective than other lipid-regulating drugs at lowering LDL-cholesterol concentration but they are less effective than the fibrates in reducing triglyceride concentration. However, statins reduce cardiovascular disease events and total mortality irrespective of the initial cholesterol concentration.

Bile acid sequestrants

Bile acid sequestrants effectively reduce LDL-cholesterol but can aggravate hypertriglyceridaemia. Treatment with bile acid sequestrants may be appropriate under specialist supervision if statins and ezetimibe are inappropriate, and when LDL-cholesterol is severely raised, for example in familial hypercholesterolaemia.

Fibrates

Fibrates are mainly used in those whose serum-triglyceride concentration is greater than 10 mmol/litre or in those who cannot tolerate a statin (specialist use).

Lomitapide

Lomitapide is licensed as an adjunct to dietary measures and other lipid-regulating drugs for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.

Nicotinic acid group

The value of nicotinic acid is limited by its side-effects, especially vasodilatation.

Nicotinic acid is used by specialists in combination with a statin if the statin alone cannot adequately control dyslipidaemia (raised LDL-cholesterol, triglyceridaemia, and low HDL-cholesterol).

Acipimox seems to have fewer side-effects than nicotinic acid but may be less effective in its lipid-regulating capabilities.

Omega-3 fatty acid compounds

There is no evidence that omega-3 fatty acid compounds reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

    <p>The use of local anaesthetics by injection or by application to mucous membranes to produce local analgesia is discussed in this section. </p>
    <p>Local anaesthetic drugs act by causing a reversible block to conduction along nerve fibres. They vary widely in their potency, toxicity, duration of action, stability, solubility in water, and ability to penetrate mucous membranes. These factors determine their application, e.g. topical (surface), infiltration, peripheral nerve block, intravenous regional anaesthesia (Bier’s block), plexus, epidural (extradural), or spinal (intrathecal or subarachnoid) block.

Bupivacaine hydrochloride has a longer duration of action than other local anaesthetics. It has a slow onset of action, taking up to 30 minutes for full effect. It is often used in lumbar epidural blockade and is particularly suitable for continuous epidural analgesia in labour, or for postoperative pain relief. It is the principal drug used for spinal anaesthesia. Hyperbaric solutions containing glucose may be used for spinal block.

Chloroprocaine hydrochloride, a para-aminobenzoic acid ester, is used for spinal anaesthesia in adults where the planned procedure should not exceed 40 minutes.

Levobupivacaine, an isomer of bupivacaine, has anaesthetic and analgesic properties similar to bupivacaine hydrochloride, but is thought to have fewer adverse effects.

Lidocaine hydrochloride is effectively absorbed from mucous membranes and is a useful surface anaesthetic in concentrations up to 10%. Except for surface anaesthesia and dental anaesthesia, solutions should not usually exceed 1% in strength. The duration of the block (with adrenaline/epinephrine) is about 90 minutes.

Prilocaine hydrochloride is a local anaesthetic of low toxicity which is similar to lidocaine hydrochloride. A hyperbaric solution of prilocaine hydrochloride (containing glucose) may be used for spinal anaesthesia.

Ropivacaine hydrochloride is an amide-type local anaesthetic agent similar to bupivacaine hydrochloride. It is less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine hydrochloride, but also less potent.

Tetracaine, a para-aminobenzoic acid ester, is an effective local anaesthetic for topical application; a 4% gel is indicated for anaesthesia before venepuncture or venous cannulation. It is rapidly absorbed from mucous membranes and should never be applied to inflamed, traumatised, or highly vascular surfaces. It should never be used to provide anaesthesia for bronchoscopy or cystoscopy because lidocaine hydrochloride is a safer alternative.

Administration

The dose of local anaesthetic depends on the injection site and the procedure used. In determining the safe dosage, it is important to take account of the rate of absorption and excretion, and of the potency. The patient’s age, weight, physique, and clinical condition, and the vascularity of the administration site and the duration of administration, must also be considered.

Uptake of local anaesthetics into the systemic circulation determines their duration of action and produces toxicity.

Great care must be taken to avoid accidental intravascular injection; local anaesthetic injections should be given slowly in order to detect inadvertent intravascular administration. When prolonged analgesia is required, a long-acting local anaesthetic is preferred to minimise the likelihood of cumulative systemic toxicity. Local anaesthesia around the oral cavity may impair swallowing and therefore increases the risk of aspiration.

Epidural anaesthesia is commonly used during surgery, often combined with general anaesthesia, because of its protective effect against the stress response of surgery. It is often used when good postoperative pain relief is essential.

Use of vasoconstrictors

Local anaesthetics cause dilatation of blood vessels. The addition of a vasoconstrictor such as adrenaline/epinephrine to the local anaesthetic preparation diminishes local blood flow, slowing the rate of absorption and thereby prolonging the anaesthetic effect. Great care should be taken to avoid inadvertent intravenous administration of a preparation containing adrenaline/epinephrine, and it is not advisable to give adrenaline/epinephrine with a local anaesthetic injection in digits or appendages because of the risk of ischaemic necrosis.

Adrenaline/epinephrine must be used in a low concentration when administered with a local anaesthetic. Care must also be taken to calculate a safe maximum dose of local anaesthetic when using combination products.

In patients with severe hypertension or unstable cardiac rhythm, the use of adrenaline/epinephrine with a local anaesthetic may be hazardous. For these patients an anaesthetic without adrenaline/epinephrine should be used.

Dental anaesthesia

Lidocaine hydrochloride is widely used in dental procedures; it is most often used in combination with adrenaline/epinephrine. Lidocaine hydrochloride 2% combined with adrenaline/epinephrine 1 in 80 000 (12.5 micrograms/mL) is a safe and effective preparation; there is no justification for using higher concentrations of adrenaline/epinephrine.

The amide-type local anaesthetics articaine and mepivacaine hydrochloride are also used in dentistry; they are available in cartridges suitable for dental use. Mepivacaine hydrochloride is available with or without adrenaline/epinephrine and articaine is available with adrenaline.

In patients with severe hypertension or unstable cardiac rhythm, mepivacaine hydrochloride without adrenaline/epinephrine may be used. Alternatively, prilocaine hydrochloride with or without felypressin can be used but there is no evidence that it is any safer. Felypressin can cause coronary vasoconstriction when used at high doses; limit dose in patients with coronary artery disease.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Prophylaxis</p>
    <p>The recommendations on prophylaxis reflect guidelines agreed by UK malaria specialists; the advice is aimed at residents of the UK who travel to endemic areas. The choice of drug for a particular individual should take into account:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>risk of exposure to malaria</li>
      <li>extent of drug resistance</li>
      <li>efficacy of the recommended drugs</li>
      <li>side-effects of the drugs</li>
      <li>patient-related factors (e.g. age, pregnancy, renal or hepatic impairment, compliance with prophylactic regimen)</li>
    </ul>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Protection against bites</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prophylaxis is not absolute</b>, and breakthrough infection can occur with any of the drugs recommended. Personal protection against being bitten is very important. Mosquito nets impregnated with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/permethrin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8080\">permethrin</xref> provide the most effective barrier protection against insects; mats and vaporised insecticides are also useful. Diethyltoluamide (DEET) 20–50% in lotions, sprays, or roll-on formulations is safe and effective when applied to the skin of adults and children over 2 months of age. It can also be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. The duration of protection varies according to the concentration of DEET and is longest for DEET 50%. When sunscreen is also required, DEET should be applied after the sunscreen. DEET reduces the SPF of sunscreen, so a sunscreen of SPF 30-50 should be applied. Long sleeves and trousers worn after dusk also provide protection against bites.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Length of prophylaxis</p>
      <p>In order to determine tolerance and to establish habit, prophylaxis should generally be started one week (2–3 weeks in the case of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mefloquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3948\">mefloquine</xref>) before travel into an endemic area; <i>Malarone</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/doxycycline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3445\">doxycycline</xref> prophylaxis should be started 1–2 days before travel. Prophylaxis should be continued for <b>4 weeks after leaving</b> (except for <i>Malarone</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> prophylaxis which should be stopped 1 week after leaving). For extensive journeys across different regions, the traveller must be protected in all areas of risk.</p>
      <p>In those requiring long-term prophylaxis, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chloroquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3939\">chloroquine</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/proguanil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3954\">proguanil hydrochloride</xref> may be used for periods of over 5 years. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mefloquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3948\">Mefloquine</xref> is licensed for up to 1 year (although, if it is tolerated in the short term, there is no evidence of harm when it is used for up to 3 years). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/doxycycline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3445\">Doxycycline</xref> can be used for up to 2 years. <i>Malarone</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> can be used for up to 1 year. Prophylaxis with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mefloquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3948\">mefloquine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/doxycycline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3445\">doxycycline</xref>, or <i>Malarone</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> may be considered for longer durations if it is justified by the risk of exposure to malaria. Specialist advice should be sought for long-term prophylaxis.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Return from malarial region</p>
      <p>It is important to be aware that <b>any illness</b> that occurs within 1 year and <b>especially within 3 months of return might be malaria</b> even if all recommended precautions against malaria were taken. Travellers should be <b>warned</b> of this and told that if they develop any illness <b>particularly within 3 months</b> of their return they should go <b>immediately</b> to a doctor and specifically mention their exposure to malaria.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Epilepsy</p>
      <p>Both <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chloroquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3939\">chloroquine</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mefloquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3948\">mefloquine</xref> are unsuitable for malaria prophylaxis in individuals with a history of epilepsy. In areas <i>without chloroquine resistance</i> proguanil alone is recommended; in areas <i>with chloroquine resistance</i>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/doxycycline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3445\">doxycycline</xref> or <i>Malarone</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> may be considered.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Asplenia</p>
      <p>Asplenic individuals (or those with severe splenic dysfunction) are at particular risk of severe malaria. If travel to malarious areas is unavoidable, rigorous precautions are required against contracting the disease.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Renal impairment</p>
      <p>Avoidance (or dosage reduction) of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/proguanil-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3954\">proguanil hydrochloride</xref> is recommended since it is excreted by the kidneys. <i>Malarone</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> should not be used for prophylaxis in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/minute/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chloroquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3939\">Chloroquine</xref> is only partially excreted by the kidneys and reduction of the dose for prophylaxis is not required except in severe impairment. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mefloquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3948\">Mefloquine</xref> is considered to be appropriate to use in renal impairment and does not require dosage reduction. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/doxycycline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3445\">Doxycycline</xref> is also considered to be appropriate.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Pregnancy</p>

The recommendations on prophylaxis reflect guidelines agreed by UK malaria specialists; the advice is aimed at residents of the UK who travel to endemic areas. The choice of drug for a particular individual should take into account:

risk of exposure to malariaextent of drug resistanceefficacy of the recommended drugsside-effects of the drugspatient-related factors (e.g. age, pregnancy, renal or hepatic impairment, compliance with prophylactic regimen)Protection against bites

Prophylaxis is not absolute, and breakthrough infection can occur with any of the drugs recommended. Personal protection against being bitten is very important. Mosquito nets impregnated with permethrin provide the most effective barrier protection against insects; mats and vaporised insecticides are also useful. Diethyltoluamide (DEET) 20–50% in lotions, sprays, or roll-on formulations is safe and effective when applied to the skin of adults and children over 2 months of age. It can also be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. The duration of protection varies according to the concentration of DEET and is longest for DEET 50%. When sunscreen is also required, DEET should be applied after the sunscreen. DEET reduces the SPF of sunscreen, so a sunscreen of SPF 30-50 should be applied. Long sleeves and trousers worn after dusk also provide protection against bites.

Length of prophylaxis

In order to determine tolerance and to establish habit, prophylaxis should generally be started one week (2–3 weeks in the case of mefloquine) before travel into an endemic area; Malarone or doxycycline prophylaxis should be started 1–2 days before travel. Prophylaxis should be continued for 4 weeks after leaving (except for Malarone prophylaxis which should be stopped 1 week after leaving). For extensive journeys across different regions, the traveller must be protected in all areas of risk.

In those requiring long-term prophylaxis, chloroquine and proguanil hydrochloride may be used for periods of over 5 years. Mefloquine is licensed for up to 1 year (although, if it is tolerated in the short term, there is no evidence of harm when it is used for up to 3 years). Doxycycline can be used for up to 2 years. Malarone can be used for up to 1 year. Prophylaxis with mefloquine, doxycycline, or Malarone may be considered for longer durations if it is justified by the risk of exposure to malaria. Specialist advice should be sought for long-term prophylaxis.

Return from malarial region

It is important to be aware that any illness that occurs within 1 year and especially within 3 months of return might be malaria even if all recommended precautions against malaria were taken. Travellers should be warned of this and told that if they develop any illness particularly within 3 months of their return they should go immediately to a doctor and specifically mention their exposure to malaria.

Epilepsy

Both chloroquine and mefloquine are unsuitable for malaria prophylaxis in individuals with a history of epilepsy. In areas without chloroquine resistance proguanil alone is recommended; in areas with chloroquine resistance, doxycycline or Malarone may be considered.

Asplenia

Asplenic individuals (or those with severe splenic dysfunction) are at particular risk of severe malaria. If travel to malarious areas is unavoidable, rigorous precautions are required against contracting the disease.

Renal impairment

Avoidance (or dosage reduction) of proguanil hydrochloride is recommended since it is excreted by the kidneys. Malarone should not be used for prophylaxis in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/minute/1.73m2. Chloroquine is only partially excreted by the kidneys and reduction of the dose for prophylaxis is not required except in severe impairment. Mefloquine is considered to be appropriate to use in renal impairment and does not require dosage reduction. Doxycycline is also considered to be appropriate.

Pregnancy

Travel to malarious areas should be avoided during pregnancy; if travel is unavoidable, effective prophylaxis must be used. Chloroquine and proguanil hydrochloride can be given in the usual doses during pregnancy, but these drugs are not appropriate for most areas because their effectiveness has declined, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa; in the case of proguanil hydrochloride, folic acid (dosed as a pregnancy at 'high-risk' of neural tube defects) should be given for at least the first trimester. The centres listed (see Malaria, treatment) should be consulted for advice on prophylaxis in chloroquine-resistant areas. Although the manufacturer advises that mefloquine should not be used during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk, studies of mefloquine in pregnancy (including use in the first trimester) indicate that it can be considered for travel to chloroquine-resistant areas. Doxycycline is contra-indicated during pregnancy; however, it can be used for malaria prophylaxis if other regimens are unsuitable, and if the entire course of doxycycline can be completed before 15 weeks’ gestation [unlicensed]. Malarone should be avoided during pregnancy, however, it can be considered during the second and third trimesters if there is no suitable alternative.

Breast-feeding

Prophylaxis is required in breast-fed infants; although antimalarials are present in milk, the amounts are too variable to give reliable protection.

Anticoagulants

Travellers taking warfarin sodium should begin chemoprophylaxis 2–3 weeks before departure. The INR should be stable before departure. It should be measured before starting chemoprophylaxis, 7 days after starting, and after completing the course. For prolonged stays, the INR should be checked at regular intervals.

Standby treatment

Travellers visiting remote, malarious areas for prolonged periods should carry standby treatment if they are likely to be more than 24 hours away from medical care. Self-medication should be avoided if medical help is accessible.

In order to avoid excessive self-medication, the traveller should be provided with written instructions that urgent medical attention should be sought if fever (38°C or more) develops 7 days (or more) after arriving in a malarious area and that self-treatment is indicated if medical help is not available within 24 hours of fever onset.

In view of the continuing emergence of resistant strains and of the different regimens required for different areas expert advice should be sought on the best treatment course for an individual traveller. A drug used for chemoprophylaxis should not be considered for standby treatment for the same traveller.

Specific recommendations

Where a journey requires two regimens, the regimen for the higher risk area should be used for the whole journey. Those travelling to remote or little-visited areas may require expert advice. See Recommended regimens for prophylaxis against malaria.

Important

Settled immigrants (or long-term visitors) to the UK may be unaware that any immunity they may have acquired while living in malarious areas is lost rapidly after migration to the UK, or that any non-malarious areas where they lived previously may now be malarious.

Recommendations on the treatment of malaria reflect guidelines agreed by UK malaria specialists. 

If the infective species is not known, or if the infection is mixed, initial treatment should be as for falciparum malaria with quinine, Malarone (atovaquone with proguanil hydrochloride), or Riamet (artemether with lumefantrine). Falciparum malaria can progress rapidly in unprotected individuals and antimalarial treatment should be considered in those with features of severe malaria and possible exposure, even if the initial blood tests for the organism are negative.

Falciparum malaria (treatment)

Falciparum malaria (malignant malaria) is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. In most parts of the world P. falciparum is now resistant to chloroquine which should not therefore be given for treatment.

Quinine, Malarone (atovaquone with proguanil hydrochloride), or Riamet (artemether with lumefantrine) can be given by mouth if the patient can swallow and retain tablets and there are no serious manifestations (e.g. impaired consciousness); quinine should be given by intravenous infusion if the patient is seriously ill or unable to take tablets. Mefloquine is now rarely used for treatment because of concerns about resistance.

Oralquinine is given by mouth for 5–7 days, together with or followed by either doxycycline for 7 days or clindamycin for 7 days [unlicensed].

If the parasite is likely to be sensitive, pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine as a single dose [unlicensed] may be given (instead of either clindamycin or doxycycline) together with, or after, a course of quinine.

Alternatively, Malarone, or Riamet may be given instead of quinine. It is not necessary to give clindamycin, doxycycline, or pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine after Malarone or Riamet treatment.

If the patient is seriously ill or unable to take tablets, or if more than 2% of red blood cell are parasitized, quinine should be given by intravenous infusion [unlicensed] (until patient can swallow tablets to complete the 7-day course together with or followed by either doxycycline or clindamycin).

Specialist advice should be sought in difficult cases (e.g. very high parasite count, deterioration on optimal doses of quinine, infection acquired in quinine-resistant areas of south east Asia) because intravenous artesunate may be available for ‘named-patient’ use.

Pregnancy

Falciparum malaria is particularly dangerous in pregnancy, especially in the last trimester. The adult treatment doses or oral and intravenous quinine (including the loading dose) can safely be given to pregnant women. Clinamycin should be given after quinine [unlicensed indication]. Doxycycline should be avoided in pregnancy (affects teeth and skeletal development); pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine, Malarone, and Riamet are also best avoided until more information is available. Specialist advice should be sought in difficult cases (e.g. very high parasite count, deterioration on optimal doses of quinine, infection acquired in quinine-resistant areas of south east Asia) because intravenous artesunate may be available for ‘named patient’ use.

Non-falciparum malaria (treatment)

Non-falciparum malaria is usually caused by Plasmodium vivax and less commonly by P. ovale and P. malariae.P. knowlesi is also present in the Asia-Pacific region. Chloroquine is the drug of choice for the treatment of non-falciparum malaria (but chloroquine-resistant P. vivax has been reported in the Indonesian archipelago, the Malay Peninsula, including Myanmar, and eastward to Southern Vietnam).

For the treatment of chloroquine-resistant non-falciparum malaria, Malarone [unlicensed indication], quinine, or Riamet [unlicensed indication] can be used; as with chloroquine, primaquine should be given for radical cure.

Chloroquine alone is adequate for P. malariae and P. knowlesi infections but in the case of P. vivax and P. ovale, a radical cure (to destroy parasites in the liver and thus prevent relapses) is required. This is achieved with primaquine [unlicensed] given after chloroquine, with the dose dependent on the infecting organism. For a radical cure, primaquine [unlicensed] is then given for 14 days, with the dose also dependent on the infecting organism.

Parenteral

Parenteral If the patient is unable to take oral therapy, quinine can be given by intravenous infusion [unlicensed], changed to oral chloroquine as soon as the patient’s condition permits.

Pregnancy

The adult treatment doses of chloroquine can be given for non-falciparum malaria. In the case of P.vivax or P.ovale, however, the radical cure with primaquine should be postponed until the pregnancy is over; instead chloroquine should be continued, given weekly during the pregnancy.

Stroke is associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Patients presenting with acute symptoms should be immediately transferred to hospital for accurate diagnosis of stroke type, and urgent initiation of appropriate treatment; patients should be managed by a specialist multidisciplinary stroke team.

The following notes give an overview of the initial and long-term management of transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, and intracerebral haemorrhage.

Transient ischaemic attack

Patients suspected of having a transient ischaemic attack should immediately receive aspirin (patients with aspirin hypersensitivity, or those intolerant of aspirin despite the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, should receive clopidogrel [unlicensed use] as an alternative). Following a confirmed diagnosis, patients should receive treatment for secondary prevention (see Long-term Management, under Ischaemic Stroke).

Ischaemic stroke

Initial management

Alteplase is recommended in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke if it can be administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset; it should be given by medical staff experienced in the administration of thrombolytics and the treatment of acute stroke, preferably within a specialist stroke centre. Treatment with aspirin should be initiated 24 hours after thrombolysis (or as soon as possible within 48 hours of symptom onset in patientsnot receiving thrombolysis); patients with aspirin hypersensitivity, or those intolerant of aspirin despite the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, should receive clopidogrel [unlicensed use] as an alternative.

Anticoagulants are not recommended as an alternative to antiplatelet drugs in acute ischaemic stroke in patients who are in sinus rhythm. However, parenteral anticoagulants may be indicated in patients who are symptomatic of, or at high risk of developing, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; warfarin sodium should not be commenced in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke.

Anticoagulants should be considered after cardio-embolic ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, however patients presenting with atrial fibrillation following a disabling ischaemic stroke should receive aspirin before being considered for anticoagulant treatment. Patients already receiving anticoagulation for a prosthetic heart valve who experience a disabling ischaemic stroke and are at significant risk of haemorrhagic transformation, should have their anticoagulant treatment stopped for 7 days and substituted with aspirin.

Treatment of hypertension in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke can result in reduced cerebral perfusion, and should therefore only be instituted in the event of a hypertensive emergency, or in those patients considered for thrombolysis.

Long-term management

Patients should receive long-term treatment following a transient ischaemic attack or an ischaemic stroke to reduce the risk of further cardiovascular events.

Following a transient ischaemic attack, long-term treatment with modified-release dipyridamole in combination with aspirin is recommended. If patients are intolerant of aspirin, or it is contra-indicated, then modified-release dipyridamole alone is recommended; if patients are intolerant of dipyridamole, or it is contra-indicated, then aspirin alone is recommended. Patients who are intolerant of both aspirin and dipyridamole should receive clopidogrel alone [unlicensed use].

Following an ischaemic stroke (not associated with atrial fibrillation), clopidogrel is recommended as long-term treatment. If clopidogrel is contra-indicated or not tolerated, patients should receive modified-release dipyridamole in combination with aspirin; if both aspirin and clopidogrel are contra-indicated or not tolerated, then modified-release dipyridamole alone is recommended; if both dipyridamole and clopidogrel are contra-indicated or not tolerated, then aspirin alone is recommended.

Patients with stroke associated with atrial fibrillation should be reviewed for long-term treatment with warfarin sodium or an alternative anticoagulant (see Initial Management under Ischaemic Stroke).

Anticoagulants are not routinely recommended in the long-term prevention of recurrent stroke, except in patients with atrial fibrillation.

A statin should be initiated 48 hours after stroke symptom onset, irrespective of the patient’s serum-cholesterol concentration.

Following the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, blood pressure should be measured and treatment initiated to achieve a target blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg. Beta-blockers should not be used in the management of hypertension following a stroke, unless they are indicated for a co-existing condition.

All patients should be advised to make lifestyle modifications that include beneficial changes to diet, exercise, weight, alcohol intake, and smoking.

Intracerebral haemorrhage

Initial Management

Surgical intervention may be required following intracerebral haemorrhage to remove the haematoma and relieve intracranial pressure. Patients taking anticoagulants should have this treatment stopped and reversed; anticoagulant therapy has, however, been used in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage who are symptomatic of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; placement of a caval filter is an alternative in this situation.

Long-term management

Aspirin therapy should only be given to patients at a high risk of a cardiac ischaemic event. Anticoagulant therapy is not recommended following an intracerebral haemorrhage, even in those with atrial fibrillation, unless the patient is at very high risk of an ischaemic stroke or cardiac ischaemic events; advice from a specialist should be sought in this situation. Blood pressure should be measured and treatment initiated where appropriate, taking care to avoid hypoperfusion. Statins should be avoided following intracerebral haemorrhage, however they can be used with caution when the risk of a vascular event outweighs the risk of further haemorrhage.

An antidepressant drug may also be required for the treatment of co-existing depression, but should be avoided in patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, a recent history of hypomania, or with rapid mood fluctuations.

Benzodiazepines

Use of benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam) may be helpful in the initial stages of treatment for behavioural disturbance or agitation; they should not be used for long periods because of the risk of dependence.

 Antipsychotic drugs

Antipsychotic drugs (normally olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone) are useful in acute episodes of mania and hypomania; if the response to antipsychotic drugs is inadequate, lithium or valproate may be added. An antipsychotic drug may be used concomitantly with lithium or valproate in the initial treatment of severe acute mania.

Olanzapine can be used for the long-term management of bipolar disorder in patients whose manic episode responded to olanzapine therapy. It can be given either as monotherapy, or in combination with lithium or valproate if the patient has frequent relapses or continuing functional impairment.

Asenapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, is licensed for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder.

When discontinuing antipsychotics, the dose should be reduced gradually over at least 4 weeks if the patient is continuing with other antimanic drugs; if the patient is not continuing with other antimanic drugs or if there is a history of manic relapse, a withdrawal period of up to 3 months should be considered.

Carbamazepine

Carbamazepine may be used under specialist supervision for the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder) in patients unresponsive to a combination of other prophylactic drugs; it is used in patients with rapid-cycling manic-depressive illness (4 or more affective episodes per year). The dose of carbamazepine should not normally be increased if an acute episode of mania occurs.

Valproate

Valproic acid (as the semisodium salt) and sodium valproate are used for the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Valproate (valproic acid and sodium valproate) is also used for the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder; however, it should not normally be prescribed for women of childbearing potential. In patients with frequent relapse or continuing functional impairment, consider switching therapy to lithium or olanzapine, or adding lithium or olanzapine to valproate. If a patient taking valproate experiences an acute episode of mania that is not ameliorated by increasing the valproate dose, consider concomitant therapy with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone.

Lithium

Lithium salts are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of mania, hypomania and depression in bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder), and in the prophylaxis and treatment of recurrent unipolar depression. Lithium is also used as concomitant therapy with antidepressant medication in patients who have had an incomplete response to treatment for acute bipolar depression and to augment other antidepressants in patients with treatment-resistant depression [unlicensed indication]. It is also licensed for the treatment of aggressive or self-harming behaviour. 

The decision to give prophylactic lithium requires specialist advice, and must be based on careful consideration of the likelihood of recurrence in the individual patient, and the benefit of treatment weighed against the risks. The full prophylactic effect of lithium may not occur for six to twelve months after the initiation of therapy. Olanzapine or valproate (given alone or as adjunctive therapy with lithium) are alternative prophylactic treatments in patients who experience frequent relapses or continued functional impairment.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Treatment of acute migraine</p>
    <p>Treatment of a migraine attack should be guided by response to previous treatment and the severity of the attacks. A <b>simple analgesic</b> such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> (preferably in a soluble or dispersible form) or a NSAID is often effective; concomitant <b>antiemetic</b> treatment may be required. If treatment with an analgesic is inadequate, an attack may be treated with a specific antimigraine compound such as a <b>5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist</b> (‘triptan’). <b>Ergot alkaloids</b> are rarely required now; oral preparations are associated with many side-effects and should be avoided in cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.</p>
    <p>Excessive use of acute treatments for migraine (opioid and non-opioid analgesics, 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonists, and ergotamine) is associated with medication-overuse headache (analgesic-induced headache); therefore, increasing consumption of these medicines needs careful management.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Analgesics</p>
      <p>Most migraine headaches respond to analgesics such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aspirin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2596\">aspirin</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> but because peristalsis is often reduced during migraine attacks the medication may not be sufficiently well absorbed to be effective; dispersible or effervescent preparations are therefore preferred. Compound preparations containing analgesics and antiemetics are available.</p>
      <p>The NSAID <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tolfenamic-acid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2833\">tolfenamic acid</xref> is licensed specifically for the treatment of an acute attack of migraine; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diclofenac-potassium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6424\">diclofenac potassium</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flurbiprofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6456\">flurbiprofen</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ibuprofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6461\">ibuprofen</xref> are also licensed for use in migraine.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">5HT1-receptor agonists</p>
      <p>A 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist is of considerable value in the treatment of an acute migraine attack. The 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonists (‘triptans’) act on the 5HT (serotonin) 1B/1D receptors and they are therefore sometimes referred to as 5HT<sub>1B/1D</sub>-receptor agonists. A 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist may be used during the established headache phase of an attack and is the preferred treatment in those who fail to respond to conventional analgesics.</p>
      <p>The 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonists available for treating migraine are <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/almotriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2844\">almotriptan</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/eletriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2846\">eletriptan</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/frovatriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2848\">frovatriptan</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/naratriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2850\">naratriptan</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rizatriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2852\">rizatriptan</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sumatriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2854\">sumatriptan</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/zolmitriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2859\">zolmitriptan</xref>. If a patient does not respond to one 5HT<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist, an alternative 5HT1-receptor agonist should be tried. For patients who have prolonged attacks that frequently recur despite treatment with a 5HT1-receptor agonist, combination therapy with a NSAID such as naproxen can be considered. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sumatriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2854\">Sumatriptan</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/zolmitriptan.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2859\">zolmitriptan</xref> are also used to treat cluster headache.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Ergot Alkaloids</p>
      <p>The value of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ergotamine-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2863\">ergotamine tartrate</xref> for migraine is limited by difficulties in absorption and by its side-effects, particularly nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and muscular cramps; it is best avoided. The recommended doses of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ergotamine-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2863\">ergotamine tartrate</xref> preparations should <b>not</b> be exceeded and treatment should <b>not</b> be repeated at intervals of less than 4 days.</p>
      <p> To avoid habituation the frequency of administration of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ergotamine-tartrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2863\">ergotamine tartrate</xref> should be limited to <b>no more than</b> twice a month. It should <b>never</b> be prescribed prophylactically but in the management of cluster headache a low dose is occasionally given for 1 to 2 weeks [unlicensed indication].</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>

Treatment of a migraine attack should be guided by response to previous treatment and the severity of the attacks. A simple analgesic such as aspirin, paracetamol (preferably in a soluble or dispersible form) or a NSAID is often effective; concomitant antiemetic treatment may be required. If treatment with an analgesic is inadequate, an attack may be treated with a specific antimigraine compound such as a 5HT1-receptor agonist (‘triptan’). Ergot alkaloids are rarely required now; oral preparations are associated with many side-effects and should be avoided in cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.

Excessive use of acute treatments for migraine (opioid and non-opioid analgesics, 5HT1-receptor agonists, and ergotamine) is associated with medication-overuse headache (analgesic-induced headache); therefore, increasing consumption of these medicines needs careful management.

Analgesics

Most migraine headaches respond to analgesics such as aspirin or paracetamol but because peristalsis is often reduced during migraine attacks the medication may not be sufficiently well absorbed to be effective; dispersible or effervescent preparations are therefore preferred. Compound preparations containing analgesics and antiemetics are available.

The NSAID tolfenamic acid is licensed specifically for the treatment of an acute attack of migraine; diclofenac potassium, flurbiprofen, and ibuprofen are also licensed for use in migraine.

5HT1-receptor agonists

A 5HT1-receptor agonist is of considerable value in the treatment of an acute migraine attack. The 5HT1-receptor agonists (‘triptans’) act on the 5HT (serotonin) 1B/1D receptors and they are therefore sometimes referred to as 5HT1B/1D-receptor agonists. A 5HT1-receptor agonist may be used during the established headache phase of an attack and is the preferred treatment in those who fail to respond to conventional analgesics.

The 5HT1-receptor agonists available for treating migraine are almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan. If a patient does not respond to one 5HT1-receptor agonist, an alternative 5HT1-receptor agonist should be tried. For patients who have prolonged attacks that frequently recur despite treatment with a 5HT1-receptor agonist, combination therapy with a NSAID such as naproxen can be considered. Sumatriptan or zolmitriptan are also used to treat cluster headache.

Ergot Alkaloids

The value of ergotamine tartrate for migraine is limited by difficulties in absorption and by its side-effects, particularly nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and muscular cramps; it is best avoided. The recommended doses of ergotamine tartrate preparations should not be exceeded and treatment should not be repeated at intervals of less than 4 days.

 To avoid habituation the frequency of administration of ergotamine tartrate should be limited to no more than twice a month. It should never be prescribed prophylactically but in the management of cluster headache a low dose is occasionally given for 1 to 2 weeks [unlicensed indication].

Antiemetics

Antiemetics, such as metoclopramide hydrochloride or domperidone, or phenothiazine and antihistamine antiemetics, relieve the nausea associated with migraine attacks. Antiemetics may be given by intramuscular injection or rectally if vomiting is a problem. Metoclopramide hydrochloride and domperidone have the added advantage of promoting gastric emptying and normal peristalsis; a single dose should be given at the onset of symptoms. Oral analgesic preparations containing metoclopramide hydrochloride are a convenient alternative. 

Prophylaxis of migraine

Where migraine attacks are frequent, possible provoking factors such as stress, irregular life-style (e.g. lack of sleep), or chemical triggers (e.g. alcohol and nitrates) should be sought; combined oral contraceptives may also provoke migraine.

Preventive treatment for migraine should be considered for patients who:

suffer at least two attacks a month;suffer an increasing frequency of headaches;suffer significant disability despite suitable treatment for migraine attacks;cannot take suitable treatment for migraine attacks.Prophylaxis is also necessary in some rare migraine subtypes and those at risk of migrainous infarction.

The beta-blockers propranolol hydrochloride, atenolol, metoprolol tartrate, nadolol, and timolol maleate are all effective. Propranolol hydrochloride is the most commonly used.

Tricyclic antidepressants [unlicensed indication], topiramate, sodium valproate [unlicensed indication], valproic acid [unlicensed indication], and gabapentin [unlicensed indication] are also effective for preventing migraine.

Pizotifen is an antihistamine and a serotonin-receptor antagonist, structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants. It is of limited value and may cause weight gain.

Botulinum toxin type A is licensed for the prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine.

Cluster headache and the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias

Cluster headache rarely responds to standard analgesics. Sumatriptan given by subcutaneous injection is the drug of choice for the treatment of cluster headache. If an injection is unsuitable, sumatriptan nasal spray or zolmitriptan nasal spray [both unlicensed use] may be used. Alternatively, 100% oxygen at a rate of 10–15 litres/minute for 10–20 minutes is useful in aborting an attack.

Prophylaxis of cluster headache is considered if the attacks are frequent, last over 3 weeks, or if they cannot be treated effectively. Verapamil hydrochloride or lithium [both unlicensed use] are used for prophylaxis.

Prednisolone can be used for short-term prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache [unlicensed use] either as monotherapy, or in combination with verapamil hydrochloride during verapamil titration.

Ergotamine tartrate, used on an intermittent basis is an alternative for patients with short bouts, but it should not be used for prolonged periods.

The other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, paroxysmal hemicrania (sensitive to indometacin), and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing, are seen rarely and are best managed by a specialist.

      <p>Calcium supplements are usually only required where dietary calcium intake is deficient. This dietary requirement varies with age and is relatively greater in childhood, pregnancy, and lactation, due to an increased demand, and in old age, due to impaired absorption. In osteoporosis, a calcium intake which is double the recommended amount reduces the rate of bone loss. If the actual dietary intake is less than the recommended amount, a supplement of as much as 40 mmol is appropriate.</p>
      <p>In severe acute hypocalcaemia or hypocalcaemic tetany, an initial slow intravenous injection of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/calcium-gluconate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP93600\">calcium gluconate</xref> injection 10% should be given, with plasma-calcium and ECG monitoring (risk of arrhythmias if given too rapidly), and either repeated as required or, if only temporary improvement, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion to prevent recurrence. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/calcium-chloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP93603\">Calcium chloride</xref> injection is also available, but is more irritant; care should be taken to prevent extravasation.

Calcium supplements

Calcium supplements are usually only required where dietary calcium intake is deficient. This dietary requirement varies with age and is relatively greater in childhood, pregnancy, and lactation, due to an increased demand, and in old age, due to impaired absorption. In osteoporosis, a calcium intake which is double the recommended amount reduces the rate of bone loss. If the actual dietary intake is less than the recommended amount, a supplement of as much as 40 mmol is appropriate.

In severe acute hypocalcaemia or hypocalcaemic tetany, an initial slow intravenous injection of calcium gluconate injection 10% should be given, with plasma-calcium and ECG monitoring (risk of arrhythmias if given too rapidly), and either repeated as required or, if only temporary improvement, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion to prevent recurrence. Calcium chloride injection is also available, but is more irritant; care should be taken to prevent extravasation. Oral supplements of calcium and vitamin D may also be required in persistent hypocalcaemia . Concurrent hypomagnesaemia should be corrected with magnesium sulfate.

See the role of calcium gluconate in temporarily reducing the toxic effects of hyperkalaemia.

Severe hypercalcaemia

Severe hypercalcaemia calls for urgent treatment before detailed investigation of the cause. Dehydration should be corrected first with intravenous infusion of sodium chloride 0.9%. Drugs (such as thiazides and vitamin D compounds) which promote hypercalcaemia, should be discontinued and dietary calcium should be restricted.

If severe hypercalcaemia persists drugs which inhibit mobilisation of calcium from the skeleton may be required. The bisphosphonates are useful and pamidronate disodium is probably the most effective.

Corticosteroids are widely given, but may only be useful where hypercalcaemia is due to sarcoidosis or vitamin D intoxication; they often take several days to achieve the desired effect.

Calcitonin (salmon) can be used for the treatment of hypercalcaemia associated with malignancy; it is rarely effective where bisphosphonates have failed to reduce serum calcium adequately.

After treatment of severe hypercalcaemia the underlying cause must be established. Further treatment is governed by the same principles as for initial therapy. Salt and water depletion and drugs promoting hypercalcaemia should be avoided; oral administration of a bisphosphonate may be useful.

Hyperparathyroidism

Paricalcitol is licensed for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure.

Parathyroidectomy may be indicated for hyperparathyroidism.

Hypercalciuria

Hypercalciuria should be investigated for an underlying cause, which should be treated. Where a cause is not identified (idiopathic hypercalciuria), the condition is managed by increasing fluid intake and giving bendroflumethiazide. Reducing dietary calcium intake may be beneficial but severe restriction of calcium intake has not proved beneficial and may even be harmful.

Magnesium

Magnesium is an essential constituent of many enzyme systems, particularly those involved in energy generation; the largest stores are in the skeleton.

Magnesium salts are not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, which explains the use of magnesium sulfate as an osmotic laxative.

Magnesium is excreted mainly by the kidneys and is therefore retained in renal failure, but significant hypermagnesaemia (causing muscle weakness and arrhythmias) is rare.

Hypomagnesaemia

Since magnesium is secreted in large amounts in the gastro-intestinal fluid, excessive losses in diarrhoea, stoma or fistula are the most common causes of hypomagnesaemia; deficiency may also occur in alcoholism or as a result of treatment with certain drugs. Hypomagnesaemia often causes secondary hypocalcaemia, and also hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia.

Symptomatic hypomagnesaemia is associated with a deficit of 0.5–1 mmol/kg; up to 160 mmol Mg2+ over up to 5 days may be required to replace the deficit (allowing for urinary losses). Magnesium is given initially by intravenous infusion or by intramuscular injection of magnesium sulfate; the intramuscular injection is painful. Plasma magnesium concentration should be measured to determine the rate and duration of infusion and the dose should be reduced in renal impairment. To prevent recurrence of the deficit, magnesium may be given by mouth, but there is limited evidence of benefit; magnesium glycerophosphate tablets and liquid [unlicensed] are available from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies.

Arrhythmias

Magnesium sulfate injection has also been recommended for the emergency treatment of serious arrhythmias, especially in the presence of hypokalaemia (when hypomagnesaemia may also be present) and when salvos of rapid ventricular tachycardia show the characteristic twisting wave front known as torsade de pointes.

Myocardial infarction

Limited evidence that magnesium sulfate prevents arrhythmias and reperfusion injury in patients with suspected myocardial infarction has not been confirmed by large studies. Routine use of magnesium sulfate for this purpose is not recommended. 

Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia

Magnesium sulfate injection is the drug of choice for the treatment of seizures and the prevention of recurrent seizures in women with eclampsia. Regimens may vary between hospitals. Calcium gluconate injection is used for the management of magnesium toxicity.

Magnesium sulfate injection is also of benefit in women with pre-eclampsia in whom there is concern about developing eclampsia. The patient should be monitored carefully.

Phosphorus

Phosphate supplements

Oral phosphate supplements may be required in addition to vitamin D in a small minority of patients with hypophosphataemic vitamin D-resistant rickets.

Phosphate infusion is occasionally needed in alcohol dependence or in phosphate deficiency arising from use of parenteral nutrition deficient in phosphate supplements; phosphate depletion also occurs in severe diabetic ketoacidosis.

For phosphate requirements in total parenteral nutrition regimens, see Intravenous nutrition.

Phosphate-binding agents

Calcium-containing preparations are used as phosphate-binding agents in the management of hyperphosphataemia complicating renal failure. Aluminium-containing preparations are rarely used as phosphate binding agents and can cause aluminium accumulation.

Sevelamer is licensed for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate is also licensed for the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis who have a serum-phosphate concentration of 1.78 mmol/litre or more.

Lanthanum is licensed for the control of hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis who have a serum-phosphate concentration of 1.78 mmol/litre or more that cannot be controlled by a low-phosphate diet.

Sucroferric oxyhydroxide is licensed for the control of hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. It is used as part of a multiple therapeutic approach to control the development of renal bone disease; this could include the concomitant use of a calcium supplement, a vitamin D analogue or calcimimetics.

Fluoride

Availability of adequate fluoride confers significant resistance to dental caries. It is now considered that the topical action of fluoride on enamel and plaque is more important than the systemic effect. 

When the fluoride content of drinking water is less than 700 micrograms per litre (0.7 parts per million), daily administration of fluoride tablets or drops provides suitable supplementation. Systemic fluoride supplements should not be prescribed without reference to the fluoride content of the local water supply. Infants need not receive fluoride supplements until the age of 6 months.

Dentifrices which incorporate sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate are also a convenient source of fluoride.

Individuals who are either particularly caries prone or medically compromised may be given additional protection by use of fluoride rinses or by application of fluoride gels. Rinses may be used daily or weekly; daily use of a less concentrated rinse is more effective than weekly use of a more concentrated one. High-strength gels must be applied regularly under professional supervision; extreme caution is necessary to prevent children from swallowing any excess. Less concentrated gels are available for home use. Varnishes are also available and are particularly valuable for young or disabled children since they adhere to the teeth and set in the presence of moisture.

Superficial infections of the mouth are often helped by warm mouthwashes which have a mechanical cleansing effect and cause some local hyperaemia.

A warm saline mouthwash is ideal and can be prepared either by dissolving half a teaspoonful of salt in a glassful of warm water or by diluting compound sodium chloride mouthwash with an equal volume of warm water.

Infection from Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to meticillin [now discontinued] (meticillin-resistant Staph. aureus, MRSA) and to flucloxacillin can be difficult to manage. Treatment is guided by the sensitivity of the infecting strain.

Rifampicin or fusidic acid should not be used alone because resistance may develop rapidly. A tetracycline alone or a combination of rifampicin and fusidic acid can be used for skin and soft-tissue infections caused by MRSA; clindamycin alone is an alternative. A glycopeptide (e.g. vancomycin) can be used for severe skin and soft-tissue infections associated with MRSA; if a glycopeptide is unsuitable, linezolid can be used on expert advice. As linezolid is not active against Gram-negative organisms, it can be used for mixed skin and soft-tissue infections only when other treatments are not available; linezolid must be given with other antibacterials if the infection also involves Gram-negative organisms. A combination of a glycopeptide and fusidic acidor a glycopeptide and rifampicin can be considered for skin and soft-tissue infections that have failed to respond to a single antibacterial.

Tigecycline and daptomycin are licensed for the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections involving MRSA.

A tetracycline or clindamycin can be used for bronchiectasis caused by MRSA. A glycopeptide can be used for pneumonia associated with MRSA; if a glycopeptide is unsuitable, linezolid can be used on expert advice. Linezolid must be given with other antibacterials if the infection also involves Gram-negative organisms. 

A tetracycline can be used for urinary-tract infections caused by MRSA; trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin are alternatives. A glycopeptide can be used for urinary-tract infections that are severe or resistant to other antibacterials.

A glycopeptide can be used for septicaemia associated with MRSA.

See the management of endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis associated with MRSA.

Prophylaxis with vancomycin or teicoplanin (alone or in combination with another antibacterial active against other pathogens) is appropriate for patients undergoing surgery if:

there is a history of MRSA colonisation or infection without documented eradication;there is a risk that the patient’s MRSA carriage has recurred;the patient comes from an area with a high prevalence of MRSA.See eradication of nasal carriage of MRSA in Nose.

Antiemetics should be prescribed only when the cause of vomiting is known because otherwise they may delay diagnosis, particularly in children. Antiemetics are unnecessary and sometimes harmful when the cause can be treated, such as in diabetic ketoacidosis, or in digoxin or antiepileptic overdose.

If antiemetic drug treatment is indicated, the drug is chosen according to the aetiology of vomiting.

Antihistamines are effective against nausea and vomiting resulting from many underlying conditions. There is no evidence that any one antihistamine is superior to another but their duration of action and incidence of adverse effects (drowsiness and antimuscarinic effects) differ.

The phenothiazines are dopamine antagonists and act centrally by blocking the chemoreceptor trigger zone. They are of considerable value for the prophylaxis and treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with diffuse neoplastic disease, radiation sickness, and the emesis caused by drugs such as opioids, general anaesthetics, and cytotoxics. Prochlorperazine, perphenazine, and trifluoperazine are less sedating than chlorpromazine hydrochloride; severe dystonic reactions sometimes occur with phenothiazines, especially in children. Some phenothiazines are available as rectal suppositories, which can be useful in patients with persistent vomiting or with severe nausea; prochlorperazine can also be administered as a buccal tablet which is placed between the upper lip and the gum.

Other antipsychotic drugs including haloperidol and levomepromazine are used for the relief of nausea and vomiting in terminal illness.

Metoclopramide hydrochloride is an effective antiemetic and its activity closely resembles that of the phenothiazines. Metoclopramide hydrochloride also acts directly on the gastro-intestinal tract and it may be superior to the phenothiazines for emesis associated with gastroduodenal, hepatic, and biliary disease.

Domperidone acts at the chemoreceptor trigger zone; it is licensed only for the relief of nausea and vomiting. It has the advantage over metoclopramide hydrochloride and the phenothiazines of being less likely to cause central effects such as sedation and dystonic reactions because it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. In Parkinson’s disease, it can be used to treat nausea caused by dopaminergic drugs.

Granisetron and ondansetron are of value in the management of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cytotoxics and in postoperative nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron is licensed for prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately or highly emetogenic cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Dexamethasone has antiemetic effects and it is used in vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. It can be used alone or with metoclopramide hydrochloride, prochlorperazine, lorazepam, or a 5HT3-receptor antagonist.

Aprepitant and fosaprepitant are neurokinin 1-receptor antagonists licensed for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with cisplatin-based cytotoxic chemotherapy; they are given with dexamethasone and a 5HT3-receptor antagonist.

Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid with antiemetic properties. It may be used for nausea and vomiting caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy that is unresponsive to conventional antiemetics.

Vomiting during pregnancy

Nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy is generally mild and does not require drug therapy. On rare occasions if vomiting is severe, short-term treatment with an antihistamine, such as promethazine, may be required. Prochlorperazine or metoclopramide hydrochloride are alternatives. If symptoms do not settle in 24 to 48 hours then specialist opinion should be sought. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a more serious condition, which requires regular antiemetic therapy, intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement and sometimes nutritional support. Supplementation with thiamine must be considered in order to reduce the risk of Wernicke’s encephalopathy.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting 

The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting depends on many factors including the anaesthetic used, and the type and duration of surgery. Other risk factors include female sex, non-smokers, a history of postoperative nausea and vomiting or motion sickness, and intraoperative and postoperative use of opioids. Therapy to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting should be based on the assessed risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting in each patient. Drugs used include 5HT3-receptor antagonists, droperidol, dexamethasone, some phenothiazines (e.g. prochlorperazine), and antihistamines (e.g. cyclizine). A combination of two or more antiemetic drugs that have different mechanisms of action is often indicated in those at high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting or where postoperative vomiting presents a particular danger (e.g. in some types of surgery). When a prophylactic antiemetic drug has failed, postoperative nausea and vomiting should be treated with one or more drugs from a different class.

Motion sickness

Antiemetics should be given to prevent motion sickness rather than after nausea or vomiting develop. The most effective drug for the prevention of motion sickness is hyoscine hydrobromide. The sedating antihistamines are slightly less effective against motion sickness, but are generally better tolerated than hyoscine. If a sedative effect is desired promethazine is useful, but generally a slightly less sedating antihistamine such as cyclizine or cinnarizine is preferred. Domperidone, metoclopramide hydrochloride, 5HT3-receptor antagonists, and the phenothiazines (except the antihistamine phenothiazine promethazine) are ineffective in motion sickness.

Other vestibular disorders

Management of vestibular diseases is aimed at treating the underlying cause as well as treating symptoms of the balance disturbance and associated nausea and vomiting. Vertigo and nausea associated with Ménière’s disease and middle-ear surgery can be difficult to treat.

Betahistine dihydrochloride is an analogue of histamine and is claimed to reduce endolymphatic pressure by improving the microcirculation. Betahistine dihydrochloride is licensed for vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss associated with Ménière’s disease.

A diuretic alone or combined with salt restriction may provide some benefit in vertigo associated with Ménière’s disease; antihistamines (such as cinnarizine), and phenothiazines (such as prochlorperazine) are also used. Where possible, prochlorperazine should be reserved for the treatment of acute symptoms.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy, palliative care, and migraine

Antiemetics have a role in the management of nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy, in palliative care, and associated with migraine.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Neuromuscular blocking drugs</p>
    <p>Neuromuscular blocking drugs used in anaesthesia are also known as <b>muscle relaxants</b>. By specific blockade of the neuromuscular junction they enable light anaesthesia to be used with adequate relaxation of the muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm. They also relax the vocal cords and allow the passage of a tracheal tube. Their action differs from the muscle relaxants used in musculoskeletal disorders that act on the spinal cord or brain.</p>
    <p>Patients who have received a neuromuscular blocking drug should <b>always</b> have their respiration assisted or controlled until the drug has been inactivated or antagonised. They should also receive sufficient concomitant inhalational or intravenous anaesthetic or sedative drugs to prevent awareness.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs</p>
      <p>Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs (also known as competitive muscle relaxants) compete with acetylcholine for receptor sites at the neuromuscular junction and their action can be reversed with anticholinesterases such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/neostigmine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6699\">neostigmine</xref>. Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs can be divided into the <b>aminosteroid</b> group, comprising <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pancuronium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8622\">pancuronium bromide</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rocuronium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8624\">rocuronium bromide</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/vecuronium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8627\">vecuronium bromide</xref>, and the <b>benzylisoquinolinium</b> group, comprising <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atracurium-besilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8614\">atracurium besilate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cisatracurium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8617\">cisatracurium</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mivacurium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8620\">mivacurium</xref>.</p>

These drugs can be classified by their duration of action as short-acting (15–30 minutes), intermediate-acting (30–40 minutes), and long-acting (60–120 minutes), although duration of action is dose-dependent. Drugs with a shorter or intermediate duration of action, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atracurium-besilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8614\">atracurium besilate</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/vecuronium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8627\">vecuronium bromide</xref>, are more widely used than those with a longer duration of action, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pancuronium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8622\">pancuronium bromide</xref>.</p>
      <p>Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs have no sedative or analgesic effects and are not considered to trigger malignant hyperthermia.</p>
      <p>For patients receiving intensive care and who require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, a non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drug is chosen according to its onset of effect, duration of action, and side-effects. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rocuronium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8624\">Rocuronium bromide</xref>, with a rapid onset of effect, may facilitate intubation. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atracurium-besilate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8614\">Atracurium besilate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cisatracurium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8617\">cisatracurium</xref> may be suitable for long-term neuromuscular blockade since their duration of action is not dependent on elimination by the liver or the kidneys.</p>

It undergoes non-enzymatic metabolism which is independent of liver and kidney function, thus allowing its use in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Cardiovascular effects are associated with significant histamine release; histamine release can be minimised by administering slowly or in divided doses over at least 1 minute.</p>

Neuromuscular blocking drugs used in anaesthesia are also known as muscle relaxants. By specific blockade of the neuromuscular junction they enable light anaesthesia to be used with adequate relaxation of the muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm. They also relax the vocal cords and allow the passage of a tracheal tube. Their action differs from the muscle relaxants used in musculoskeletal disorders that act on the spinal cord or brain.

Patients who have received a neuromuscular blocking drug should always have their respiration assisted or controlled until the drug has been inactivated or antagonised. They should also receive sufficient concomitant inhalational or intravenous anaesthetic or sedative drugs to prevent awareness.

Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs

Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs (also known as competitive muscle relaxants) compete with acetylcholine for receptor sites at the neuromuscular junction and their action can be reversed with anticholinesterases such as neostigmine. Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs can be divided into the aminosteroid group, comprising pancuronium bromide, rocuronium bromide, and vecuronium bromide, and the benzylisoquinolinium group, comprising atracurium besilate, cisatracurium, and mivacurium.

Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs have a slower onset of action than suxamethonium chloride. These drugs can be classified by their duration of action as short-acting (15–30 minutes), intermediate-acting (30–40 minutes), and long-acting (60–120 minutes), although duration of action is dose-dependent. Drugs with a shorter or intermediate duration of action, such as atracurium besilate and vecuronium bromide, are more widely used than those with a longer duration of action, such as pancuronium bromide.

Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs have no sedative or analgesic effects and are not considered to trigger malignant hyperthermia.

For patients receiving intensive care and who require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, a non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drug is chosen according to its onset of effect, duration of action, and side-effects. Rocuronium bromide, with a rapid onset of effect, may facilitate intubation. Atracurium besilate or cisatracurium may be suitable for long-term neuromuscular blockade since their duration of action is not dependent on elimination by the liver or the kidneys.

Atracurium besilate, a mixture of 10 isomers, is a benzylisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking drug with an intermediate duration of action. It undergoes non-enzymatic metabolism which is independent of liver and kidney function, thus allowing its use in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Cardiovascular effects are associated with significant histamine release; histamine release can be minimised by administering slowly or in divided doses over at least 1 minute.

Cisatracurium is a single isomer of atracurium besilate. It is more potent and has a slightly longer duration of action than atracurium besilate and provides greater cardiovascular stability because cisatracurium lacks histamine-releasing effects.

Mivacurium, a benzylisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking drug, has a short duration of action. It is metabolised by plasma cholinesterase and muscle paralysis is prolonged in individuals deficient in this enzyme. It is not associated with vagolytic activity or ganglionic blockade although histamine release can occur, particularly with rapid injection.

Pancuronium bromide, an aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking drug, has a long duration of action and is often used in patients receiving long-term mechanical ventilation in intensive care units. It lacks a histamine-releasing effect, but vagolytic and sympathomimetic effects can cause tachycardia and hypertension.

Rocuronium bromide exerts an effect within 2 minutes and has the most rapid onset of any of the non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs. It is an aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking drug with an intermediate duration of action. It is reported to have minimal cardiovascular effects; high doses produce mild vagolytic activity.

Vecuronium bromide, an aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking drug, has an intermediate duration of action. It does not generally produce histamine release and lacks cardiovascular effects.

Depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs

Suxamethonium chloride has the most rapid onset of action of any of the neuromuscular blocking drugs and is ideal if fast onset and brief duration of action are required, e.g. with tracheal intubation. Unlike the non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs, its action cannot be reversed and recovery is spontaneous; anticholinesterases such as neostigmine potentiate the neuromuscular block.

Suxamethonium chloride should be given after anaesthetic induction because paralysis is usually preceded by painful muscle fasciculations. While tachycardia occurs with single use, bradycardia may occur with repeated doses in adults and with the first dose in children. Premedication with atropine reduces bradycardia as well as the excessive salivation associated with suxamethonium chloride use.

Prolonged paralysis may occur in dual block, which occurs with high or repeated doses of suxamethonium chloride and is caused by the development of a non-depolarising block following the initial depolarising block. Individuals with myasthenia gravis are resistant to suxamethonium chloride but can develop dual block resulting in delayed recovery. Prolonged paralysis may also occur in those with low or atypical plasma cholinesterase. Assisted ventilation should be continued until muscle function is restored.

 Drugs for reversal of neuromuscular blockade

Anticholinesterases

Anticholinesterases reverse the effects of the non-depolarising (competitive) neuromuscular blocking drugs such as pancuronium bromide but they prolong the action of the depolarising neuromuscular blocking drug suxamethonium chloride.

Neostigmine is used specifically for reversal of non-depolarising (competitive) blockade. It acts within one minute of intravenous injection and its effects last for 20 to 30 minutes; a second dose may then be necessary. Glycopyrronium bromide or alternatively atropine sulfate, given before or with neostigmine, prevent bradycardia, excessive salivation, and other muscarinic effects of neostigmine.

Other drugs for reversal of neuromuscular blockade

Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin that can be used for rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide. In practice, sugammadex is used mainly for rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade in an emergency.

    <p>Anticholinesterases are used as first-line treatment in <i>ocular myasthenia gravis</i> and as an adjunct to immunosuppressant therapy for <i>generalised myasthenia gravis</i>.</p>
    <p>Corticosteroids are used when anticholinesterases do not control symptoms completely. A second-line immunosuppressant such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/azathioprine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP527\">azathioprine</xref> is frequently used to reduce the dose of corticosteroid.</p>
    <p>Plasmapheresis or infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin [unlicensed indication] may induce temporary remission in severe relapses, particularly where bulbar or respiratory function is compromised or before thymectomy.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Anticholinesterases</p>
      <p>Anticholinesterase drugs enhance neuromuscular transmission in voluntary and involuntary muscle in myasthenia gravis. Excessive dosage of these drugs can impair neuromuscular transmission and precipitate cholinergic crises by causing a depolarising block. This may be difficult to distinguish from a worsening myasthenic state.</p>
      <p>Muscarinic side-effects of anticholinesterases include increased sweating, increased salivary and gastric secretions, increased gastro-intestinal and uterine motility, and bradycardia. These parasympathomimetic effects are antagonised by <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atropine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP356\">atropine sulfate</xref>.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/neostigmine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6699\">Neostigmine</xref> produces a therapeutic effect for up to 4 hours. Its pronounced muscarinic action is a disadvantage, and simultaneous administration of an antimuscarinic drug such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/atropine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP356\">atropine sulfate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/propantheline-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP369\">propantheline bromide</xref> may be required to prevent colic, excessive salivation, or diarrhoea. In severe disease neostigmine can be given every 2 hours. The maximum that most patients can tolerate is 180 mg daily.</p>

        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pyridostigmine-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6709\">Pyridostigmine bromide</xref> is less powerful and slower in action than <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/neostigmine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6699\">neostigmine</xref> but it has a longer duration of action. It is preferable to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/neostigmine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6699\">neostigmine</xref> because of its smoother action and the need for less frequent dosage. It is particularly preferred in patients whose muscles are weak on waking. It has a comparatively mild gastrointestinal effect but an antimuscarinic drug may still be required. </p>

        <b>Corticosteroids</b> are established as treatment for myasthenia gravis; although they are commonly given on alternate days there is little evidence of benefit over daily administration.

      <p>In <i>generalised myasthenia gravis</i><xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/prednisolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP519\">prednisolone</xref> is given. About 10% of patients experience a transient but very serious worsening of symptoms in the first 2–3 weeks, especially if the corticosteroid is started at a high dose. Smaller doses of corticosteroid are usually required in <i>ocular myasthenia</i>. Once clinical remission has occurred (usually after 2–6 months), the dose of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/prednisolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP519\">prednisolone</xref> should be reduced slowly to the minimum effective dose.</p>

    <p>The drugs described are used for the relief of chronic muscle spasm or spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or other neurological damage; they are not indicated for spasm associated with minor injuries. Baclofen, diazepam, and tizanidine act principally on the central nervous system. Dantrolene has a peripheral site of action; cannabis extract has both a central and a peripheral action. Skeletal muscle relaxants differ in action from the muscle relaxants used in anaesthesia, which block transmission at the neuromuscular junction.</p>
    <p>The underlying cause of spasticity should be treated and any aggravating factors (e.g. pressure sores, infection) remedied. Skeletal muscle relaxants are effective in most forms of spasticity except the rare alpha variety. The major disadvantage of treatment with these drugs is that reduction in muscle tone can cause a loss of splinting action of the spastic leg and trunk muscles and sometimes lead to an increase in disability.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/baclofen.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6720\">Baclofen</xref> inhibits transmission at spinal level and also depresses the central nervous system. The dose should be increased slowly to avoid the major side-effects of sedation and muscular hypotonia (other adverse events are uncommon).</p>
    <p>A <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/cannabis-extract.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6725\">cannabis extract</xref> containing dronabinol (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and cannabidiol is licensed as an adjunct treatment for moderate to severe spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis in patients who have not responded adequately to other skeletal muscle relaxants.

Anticholinesterases are used as first-line treatment in ocular myasthenia gravis and as an adjunct to immunosuppressant therapy for generalised myasthenia gravis.

Corticosteroids are used when anticholinesterases do not control symptoms completely. A second-line immunosuppressant such as azathioprine is frequently used to reduce the dose of corticosteroid.

Plasmapheresis or infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin [unlicensed indication] may induce temporary remission in severe relapses, particularly where bulbar or respiratory function is compromised or before thymectomy.

Anticholinesterases

Anticholinesterase drugs enhance neuromuscular transmission in voluntary and involuntary muscle in myasthenia gravis. Excessive dosage of these drugs can impair neuromuscular transmission and precipitate cholinergic crises by causing a depolarising block. This may be difficult to distinguish from a worsening myasthenic state.

Muscarinic side-effects of anticholinesterases include increased sweating, increased salivary and gastric secretions, increased gastro-intestinal and uterine motility, and bradycardia. These parasympathomimetic effects are antagonised by atropine sulfate.

Neostigmine produces a therapeutic effect for up to 4 hours. Its pronounced muscarinic action is a disadvantage, and simultaneous administration of an antimuscarinic drug such as atropine sulfate or propantheline bromide may be required to prevent colic, excessive salivation, or diarrhoea. In severe disease neostigmine can be given every 2 hours. The maximum that most patients can tolerate is 180 mg daily.

Pyridostigmine bromide is less powerful and slower in action than neostigmine but it has a longer duration of action. It is preferable to neostigmine because of its smoother action and the need for less frequent dosage. It is particularly preferred in patients whose muscles are weak on waking. It has a comparatively mild gastrointestinal effect but an antimuscarinic drug may still be required. 

Neostigmine is also used to reverse the actions of the non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Immunosuppressant therapy

Corticosteroids are established as treatment for myasthenia gravis; although they are commonly given on alternate days there is little evidence of benefit over daily administration. Corticosteroid treatment is usually initiated under in-patient supervision and all patients should receive osteoporosis prophylaxis.

In generalised myasthenia gravisprednisolone is given. About 10% of patients experience a transient but very serious worsening of symptoms in the first 2–3 weeks, especially if the corticosteroid is started at a high dose. Smaller doses of corticosteroid are usually required in ocular myasthenia. Once clinical remission has occurred (usually after 2–6 months), the dose of prednisolone should be reduced slowly to the minimum effective dose.

In generalised myasthenia gravis azathioprine is usually started at the same time as the corticosteroid and it allows a lower maintenance dose of the corticosteroid to be used. Ciclosporin, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil can be used in patients unresponsive or intolerant to other treatments [unlicensed indications].

Acetylcholine-release enhancers

Amifampridine is licensed for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), a rare disorder of neuromuscular transmission.

Fampridine is licensed for the improvement of walking in patients with multiple sclerosis who have a walking disability.

Skeletal muscle relaxants

The drugs described are used for the relief of chronic muscle spasm or spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or other neurological damage; they are not indicated for spasm associated with minor injuries. Baclofen, diazepam, and tizanidine act principally on the central nervous system. Dantrolene has a peripheral site of action; cannabis extract has both a central and a peripheral action. Skeletal muscle relaxants differ in action from the muscle relaxants used in anaesthesia, which block transmission at the neuromuscular junction.

The underlying cause of spasticity should be treated and any aggravating factors (e.g. pressure sores, infection) remedied. Skeletal muscle relaxants are effective in most forms of spasticity except the rare alpha variety. The major disadvantage of treatment with these drugs is that reduction in muscle tone can cause a loss of splinting action of the spastic leg and trunk muscles and sometimes lead to an increase in disability.

Baclofen inhibits transmission at spinal level and also depresses the central nervous system. The dose should be increased slowly to avoid the major side-effects of sedation and muscular hypotonia (other adverse events are uncommon).

A cannabis extract containing dronabinol (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and cannabidiol is licensed as an adjunct treatment for moderate to severe spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis in patients who have not responded adequately to other skeletal muscle relaxants. The dose should be titrated over 2 weeks; response to treatment should be reviewed after 4 weeks and treatment stopped if an adequate response is not achieved.

Dantrolene sodium acts directly on skeletal muscle and produces fewer central adverse effects making it a drug of choice. The dose should be increased slowly.

Diazepam can also be used. Sedation and occasionally extensor hypotonus are disadvantages. Other benzodiazepines also have muscle-relaxant properties. Muscle-relaxant doses of benzodiazepines are similar to anxiolytic doses.

Tizanidine is an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist indicated for spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury.

Other muscle relaxants

The clinical efficacy of methocarbamol and meprobamate as muscle relaxants is not well established, although they have been included in compound analgesic preparations.

Neuropathic pain, which occurs as a result of damage to neural tissue, includes phantom limb pain, compression neuropathies, peripheral neuropathies (e.g. due to Diabetes, chronic excessive alcohol intake, HIV infection, chemotherapy, idiopathic neuropathy), trauma, central pain (e.g. pain following stroke, spinal cord injury, and syringomyelia), and postherpetic neuralgia (peripheral nerve damage following acute herpes zoster infection (shingles)). The pain may occur in an area of sensory deficit and is sometimes accompanied by pain that is evoked by a non-noxious stimulus (allodynia).

Trigeminal neuralgia is also caused by dysfunction of neural tissue, but its management is distinct from other forms of neuropathic pain.

Neuropathic pain is generally managed with a tricyclic antidepressant or with certain antiepileptic drugs. Amitriptyline hydrochloride [unlicensed indication] and pregabalin are effective treatments for neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline hydrochloride and pregabalin can be used in combination if the patient has an inadequate response to either drug at the maximum tolerated dose.

Nortriptyline [unlicensed indication] may be better tolerated than amitriptyline hydrochloride.

Gabapentin is also effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Neuropathic pain may respond to opioid analgesics. There is evidence of efficacy for tramadol hydrochloride, morphine, and oxycodone hydrochloride; however, treatment with morphine or oxycodone hydrochloride should be initiated only under specialist supervision. Tramadol hydrochloride can be prescribed when other treatments have been unsuccessful, while the patient is waiting for assessment by a specialist.

Patients with localised pain who are unable to take oral medicines may benefit from topical local anaesthetic preparations, such as lidocaine hydrochloride medicated plasters, while awaiting specialist review.

Capsaicin is licensed for neuropathic pain (but the intense burning sensation during initial treatment may limit use). Capsaicin 0.075% cream is licensed for the symptomatic relief of postherpetic neuralgia. A self-adhesive patch containing capsaicin 8% is licensed for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic patients. It should be used under specialist supervision.

A corticosteroid may help to relieve pressure in compression neuropathy and thereby reduce pain.

Neuromodulation by spinal cord stimulation may be of benefit in some patients. Many patients with chronic neuropathic pain require multidisciplinary management, including physiotherapy and psychological support.

Trigeminal neuralgia

Surgery may be the treatment of choice in many patients; a neurological assessment will identify those who stand to benefit. Carbamazepine taken during the acute stages of trigeminal neuralgia, reduces the frequency and severity of attacks. It is very effective for the severe pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia and (less commonly) glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Blood counts and electrolytes should be monitored when high doses are given. Small doses should be used initially to reduce the incidence of side-effects e.g. dizziness. Some cases respond to phenytoin; the drug may be given by intravenous infusion (possibly as fosphenytoin sodium) in a crisis (specialist use only).

Chronic facial pain

Chronic oral and facial pain including persistent idiopathic facial pain (also termed ‘atypical facial pain’) and temporomandibular dysfunction (previously termed temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome) may call for prolonged use of analgesics or for other drugs. Tricyclic antidepressants may be useful for facial pain [unlicensed indication], but are not on the Dental Practitioners' List. Disorders of this type require specialist referral and psychological support to accompany drug treatment. Patients on long-term therapy need to be monitored both for progress and for side-effects.

    <p>In <i>single doses</i> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have analgesic activity comparable to that of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref>, but <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> is preferred, particularly in the elderly.</p>
    <p>In regular <i>full dosage</i> NSAIDs have both a lasting analgesic and an anti-inflammatory effect which makes them particularly useful for the treatment of continuous or regular pain associated with inflammation. Therefore, although <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> often gives adequate pain control in osteoarthritis, NSAIDs are more appropriate than <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/paracetamol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2632\">paracetamol</xref> or the opioid analgesics in the <i>inflammatory arthritides</i> (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and in some cases of <i>advanced osteoarthritis</i>. NSAIDs can also be of benefit in the less well defined conditions of <i>back pain</i> and <i>soft-tissue disorders</i>.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Choice</p>
      <p>Differences in anti-inflammatory activity between NSAIDs are small, but there is considerable variation in individual response and tolerance to these drugs. About 60% of patients will respond to any NSAID; of the others, those who do not respond to one may well respond to another. Pain relief starts soon after taking the first dose and a full analgesic effect should normally be obtained within a week, whereas an anti-inflammatory effect may not be achieved (or may not be clinically assessable) for up to 3 weeks. If appropriate responses are not obtained within these times, another NSAID should be tried.</p>
      <p>NSAIDs reduce the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase. They vary in their selectivity for inhibiting different types of cyclo-oxygenase; selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 is associated with less gastro-intestinal intolerance. Several other factors also influence susceptibility to gastrointestinal effects, and a NSAID should be chosen on the basis of the incidence of gastro-intestinal and other side-effects.</p>

In single doses non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have analgesic activity comparable to that of paracetamol, but paracetamol is preferred, particularly in the elderly.

In regular full dosage NSAIDs have both a lasting analgesic and an anti-inflammatory effect which makes them particularly useful for the treatment of continuous or regular pain associated with inflammation. Therefore, although paracetamol often gives adequate pain control in osteoarthritis, NSAIDs are more appropriate than paracetamol or the opioid analgesics in the inflammatory arthritides (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and in some cases of advanced osteoarthritis. NSAIDs can also be of benefit in the less well defined conditions of back pain and soft-tissue disorders.

Choice

Differences in anti-inflammatory activity between NSAIDs are small, but there is considerable variation in individual response and tolerance to these drugs. About 60% of patients will respond to any NSAID; of the others, those who do not respond to one may well respond to another. Pain relief starts soon after taking the first dose and a full analgesic effect should normally be obtained within a week, whereas an anti-inflammatory effect may not be achieved (or may not be clinically assessable) for up to 3 weeks. If appropriate responses are not obtained within these times, another NSAID should be tried.

NSAIDs reduce the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase. They vary in their selectivity for inhibiting different types of cyclo-oxygenase; selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 is associated with less gastro-intestinal intolerance. Several other factors also influence susceptibility to gastrointestinal effects, and a NSAID should be chosen on the basis of the incidence of gastro-intestinal and other side-effects.

Ibuprofen is a propionic acid derivative with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. It has fewer side-effects than other non-selective NSAIDs but its anti-inflammatory properties are weaker. It is unsuitable for conditions where inflammation is prominent, such as acute gout. Dexibuprofen is the active enantiomer of ibuprofen. It has similar properties to ibuprofen and is licensed for the relief of mild to moderate pain and inflammation.

Other propionic acid derivatives:

Naproxen is one of the first choices because it combines good efficacy with a low incidence of side-effects (but more than ibuprofen).

Fenoprofen is as effective as naproxen, and flurbiprofen may be slightly more effective. Both are associated with slightly more gastro-intestinal side-effects than ibuprofen.

Ketoprofen has anti-inflammatory properties similar to ibuprofen and has more side-effects. Dexketoprofen, an isomer of ketoprofen, has been introduced for the short-term relief of mild to moderate pain.

Tiaprofenic acid is as effective as naproxen; it has more side-effects than ibuprofen.

 Drugs with properties similar to those of propionic acid derivatives:

Diclofenac sodium and aceclofenac are similar in efficacy to naproxen.

Etodolac is comparable in efficacy to naproxen; it is licensed for symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Indometacin has an action equal to or superior to that of naproxen, but with a high incidence of side-effects including headache, dizziness, and gastro-intestinal disturbances.

Mefenamic acid has minor anti-inflammatory properties. It has occasionally been associated with diarrhoea and haemolytic anaemia which require discontinuation of treatment.

Meloxicam is licensed for the short-term relief of pain in osteoarthritis and for long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.

Nabumetone is comparable in effect to naproxen.

Phenylbutazone is licensed for ankylosing spondylitis, but is not recommended because it is associated with serious side-effects, in particular haematological reactions; it should be used only by a specialist in severe cases where other treatments have been found unsuitable.

Piroxicam is as effective as naproxen and has a long duration of action which permits once-daily administration. However, it has more gastro-intestinal side-effects than most other NSAIDs, and is associated with more frequent serious skin reactions.

Sulindac is similar in tolerance to naproxen.

Tenoxicam is similar in activity and tolerance to naproxen. Its long duration of action allows once-daily administration.

Tolfenamic acid is licensed for the treatment of migraine.

Ketorolac trometamol and the selective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase-2, parecoxib, are licensed for the short-term management of postoperative pain.

The selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2, etoricoxib and celecoxib, are as effective as non-selective NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and naproxen. Although selective inhibitors can cause serious gastro-intestinal events, available evidence appears to indicate that the risk of serious upper gastro-intestinal events is lower with selective inhibitors compared to non-selective NSAIDs; this advantage may be lost in patients who require concomitant low-dose aspirin.

Celecoxib and etoricoxib are licensed for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; etoricoxib is also licensed for the relief of pain from acute gout.

Aspirin has been used in high doses to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but other NSAIDs are now preferred.

Dental and orofacial pain

Most mild to moderate dental pain and inflammation is effectively relieved by NSAIDs. Those used for dental pain include ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium, and diclofenac potassium.

Asthma

Any degree of worsening of asthma may be related to the ingestion of NSAIDs, either prescribed or (in the case of ibuprofen and others) purchased over the counter.

NSAIDs and cardiovascular events

All NSAID use (including cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors) can, to varying degrees, be associated with a small increased risk of thrombotic events (e.g. myocardial infarction and stroke) independent of baseline cardiovascular risk factors or duration of NSAID use; however, the greatest risk may be in those receiving high doses long term.

Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors, diclofenac (150 mg daily) and ibuprofen (2.4 g daily) are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events. Although there are limited data regarding the thrombotic effects of aceclofenac, treatment advice has been updated in line with diclofenac, based on aceclofenac's structural similarity to diclofenac and its metabolism to diclofenac. The increased risk for diclofenac is similar to that of licensed doses of etoricoxib. Naproxen (1 g daily) is associated with a lower thrombotic risk, and low doses of ibuprofen (1.2 g daily or less) have not been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction.

The lowest effective dose of NSAID should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to control symptoms and the need for long-term treatment should be reviewed periodically.

NSAIDs and gastro-intestinal events

All NSAIDs are associated with serious gastro-intestinal toxicity; the risk is higher in the elderly. Evidence on the relative safety of non-selective NSAIDs indicates differences in the risks of serious upper gastro-intestinal side-effects—piroxicam, ketoprofen, and ketorolac trometamol are associated with the highest risk; indometacin, diclofenac, and naproxen are associated with intermediate risk, and ibuprofen with the lowest risk (although high doses of ibuprofen have been associated with intermediate risk). Selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 are associated with a lower risk of serious upper gastro-intestinal side-effects than non-selective NSAIDs.

Recommendations are that NSAIDs associated with a low risk e.g. ibuprofen are generally preferred, to start at the lowest recommended doseand not to use more than one oral NSAID at a time.

The combination of a NSAID and low-dose aspirin can increase the risk of gastro-intestinal side-effects; this combination should be used only if absolutely necessary and the patient should be monitored closely.

While it is preferable to avoid NSAIDs in patients with active or previous gastro-intestinal ulceration or bleeding, and to withdraw them if gastro-intestinal lesions develop, nevertheless patients with serious rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) are usually dependent on NSAIDs for effective relief of pain and stiffness.

Patients at risk of gastro-intestinal ulceration (including the elderly), who need NSAID treatment should receive gastroprotective treatment.

Systemic as well as local effects of NSAIDs contribute to gastro–intestinal damage; taking oral formulations with milk or food, or using enteric-coated formulations, or changing the route of administration may only partially reduce symptoms such as dyspepsia.

    <p>Rhinitis is often self-limiting but bacterial sinusitis may require treatment with antibacterials. There are few indications for nasal sprays and drops except in allergic rhinitis and perennial rhinitis. Many nasal preparations contain sympathomimetic drugs which may damage the nasal cilia. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-chloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5143\">Sodium chloride</xref> 0.9% solution may be used as a douche or ‘sniff’ following endonasal surgery.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Drugs used in nasal allergy</p>
    <p>Mild allergic rhinitis is controlled by <b>antihistamines</b> (see under <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"treatment-summary/antihistamines-allergen-immunotherapy-and-allergic-emergencies.xml\" type=\"bookmark\" rel=\"treatmentsummary\" bnfid=\"PHP78111\">Antihistamines, allergen immunotherapy and allergic emergencies</xref>) or topical <b>nasal corticosteroids</b>; systemic nasal decongestants are of doubtful value. Topical nasal decongestants can be used for a short period to relieve congestion and allow penetration of a topical nasal corticosteroid.</p>
    <p>More persistent symptoms and nasal congestion can be relieved by topical nasal <b>corticosteroids</b>; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-cromoglicate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP541\">sodium cromoglicate</xref> is an alternative, but may be less effective. The topical antihistamine <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/azelastine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6904\">azelastine hydrochloride</xref> is useful for controlling breakthrough symptoms in allergic rhinitis. Topical antihistamines are considered less effective than topical corticosteroids but probably more effective than cromoglicate. In seasonal allergic rhinitis (e.g. hay fever), treatment should begin 2 to 3 weeks before the season commences and may have to be continued for several months; continuous treatment may be required for years in perennial rhinitis.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/montelukast.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1887\">Montelukast</xref> is less effective than topical nasal corticosteroids; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/montelukast.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1887\">montelukast</xref> can be used in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma.</p>
    <p>Sometimes allergic rhinitis is accompanied by vasomotor rhinitis. In this situation, the addition of topical nasal ipratropium bromide can reduce watery rhinorrhoea.</p>

Rhinitis is often self-limiting but bacterial sinusitis may require treatment with antibacterials. There are few indications for nasal sprays and drops except in allergic rhinitis and perennial rhinitis. Many nasal preparations contain sympathomimetic drugs which may damage the nasal cilia. Sodium chloride 0.9% solution may be used as a douche or ‘sniff’ following endonasal surgery.

Drugs used in nasal allergy

Mild allergic rhinitis is controlled by antihistamines (see under Antihistamines, allergen immunotherapy and allergic emergencies) or topical nasal corticosteroids; systemic nasal decongestants are of doubtful value. Topical nasal decongestants can be used for a short period to relieve congestion and allow penetration of a topical nasal corticosteroid.

More persistent symptoms and nasal congestion can be relieved by topical nasal corticosteroids; sodium cromoglicate is an alternative, but may be less effective. The topical antihistamine azelastine hydrochloride is useful for controlling breakthrough symptoms in allergic rhinitis. Topical antihistamines are considered less effective than topical corticosteroids but probably more effective than cromoglicate. In seasonal allergic rhinitis (e.g. hay fever), treatment should begin 2 to 3 weeks before the season commences and may have to be continued for several months; continuous treatment may be required for years in perennial rhinitis.

Montelukast is less effective than topical nasal corticosteroids; montelukast can be used in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma.

Sometimes allergic rhinitis is accompanied by vasomotor rhinitis. In this situation, the addition of topical nasal ipratropium bromide can reduce watery rhinorrhoea.

Very disabling symptoms occasionally justify the use of systemic corticosteroids for short periods, for example, in students taking important examinations. They may also be used at the beginning of a course of treatment with a corticosteroid spray to relieve severe mucosal oedema and allow the spray to penetrate the nasal cavity.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroid nasal preparations should be avoided in the presence of untreated nasal infections, after nasal surgery (until healing has occurred), and in pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients transferred from systemic corticosteroids may experience exacerbation of some symptoms. Systemic absorption may follow nasal administration particularly if high doses are used or if treatment is prolonged; for cautions and side-effects of systemic corticosteroids. The risk of systemic effects may be greater with nasal drops than with nasal sprays; drops are administered incorrectly more often than sprays. The height of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal corticosteroids should be monitored; if growth is slowed, referral to a paediatrician should be considered.

Nasal polyps

Short-term use of corticosteroid nasal drops helps to shrink nasal polyps; to be effective, the drops must be administered with the patient in the ‘head down’ position. A short course of a systemic corticosteroid may be required initially to shrink large polyps. A corticosteroid nasal spray can be used to maintain the reduction in swelling and also for the initial treatment of small polyps.

Pregnancy

If a pregnant woman cannot tolerate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, treatment with nasal beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone, or sodium cromoglicate may be considered.

Topical nasal decongestants

The nasal mucosa is sensitive to changes in atmospheric temperature and humidity and these alone may cause slight nasal congestion. The nose and nasal sinuses produce a litre of mucus in 24 hours and much of this finds its way silently into the stomach via the nasopharynx. Slight changes in the nasal airway, accompanied by an awareness of mucus passing along the nasopharynx causes some patients to be inaccurately diagnosed as suffering from chronic sinusitis. These symptoms are particularly noticeable in the later stages of the common cold. Sodium chloride 0.9% given as nasal drops or spray may relieve nasal congestion by helping to liquefy mucous secretions.

Inhalation of warm moist air is useful in the treatment of symptoms of acute infective conditions. The addition of volatile substances such as menthol and eucalyptus may encourage the use of warm moist air (see under Aromatic inhalations, cough preparations and systemic nasal decongestants).

Symptoms of nasal congestion associated with vasomotor rhinitis and the common cold can be relieved by the short-term use (usually not longer than 7 days) of decongestant nasal drops and sprays. These all contain sympathomimetic drugs which exert their effect by vasoconstriction of the mucosal blood vessels which in turn reduces oedema of the nasal mucosa.

Ephedrine hydrochloride nasal drops is the safest sympathomimetic preparation and can give relief for several hours. The more potent sympathomimetic drugs oxymetazoline and xylometazoline hydrochloride are more likely to cause a rebound effect.

Non-allergic watery rhinorrhoea often responds well to treatment with the antimuscarinic ipratropium bromide.

Sinusitis and oral pain

Sinusitis affecting the maxillary antrum can cause pain in the upper jaw. Where this is associated with blockage of the opening from the sinus into the nasal cavity, it may be helpful to relieve the congestion with inhalation of warm moist air or with ephedrine hydrochloride nasal drops.

Systemic antibacterials may sometimes be required for sinusitis (see under Nose infections, bacterial).

Nasal preparations for infection

There is no evidence that topical anti-infective nasal preparations have any therapeutic value in rhinitis or sinusitis; see elimination of nasal staphylococci.

Nasal staphylococci

Elimination of organisms such as staphylococci from the nasal vestibule can be achieved by the use of a cream containing chlorhexidine and neomycin (Naseptin), but re-colonisation frequently occurs. Coagulase-positive staphylococci are present in the noses of 40% of the population.

A nasal ointment containing mupirocin is also available; it should probably be held in reserve for resistant infections. In hospitals or in care establishments, mupirocin nasal ointment should be reserved for the eradication (in both patients and staff) of nasal carriage of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A sample should be taken 2 days after treatment to confirm eradication. The course may be repeated if the sample is positive (and the throat is not colonised). To avoid the development of resistance, the treatment course should not exceed 7 days and the course should not be repeated on more than one occasion. If the MRSA strain is mupirocin-resistant or does not respond after 2 courses, consider alternative products such as chlorhexidine and neomycin cream.

Smoking cessation (while maintaining body weight) may be worthwhile before attempting supervised weight loss since cigarette smoking may be more harmful than obesity. Attendance at weight loss groups helps some individuals.</p>

    <p>An anti-obesity drug should be considered only for those with a body mass index (BMI, individual’s bodyweight divided by the square of the individual’s height) of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater in whom at least 3 months of managed care involving supervised diet, exercise and behaviour modification fails to achieve a realistic reduction in weight. In the presence of associated risk factors, it may be appropriate to prescribe an anti-obesity drug to individuals with a BMI of 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater. Drugs should <b>never</b> be used as the sole element of treatment. The individual should be monitored on a regular basis; drug treatment should be discontinued if the individual regains weight at any time whilst receiving drug treatment.</p>

Obesity is associated with many health problems including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, gallstones and osteoarthritis. Factors that aggravate obesity may include depression, other psychosocial problems, and some drugs.

The main treatment of the obese individual is a suitable diet, carefully explained to the individual, with appropriate support and encouragement; the individual should also be advised to increase physical activity. Smoking cessation (while maintaining body weight) may be worthwhile before attempting supervised weight loss since cigarette smoking may be more harmful than obesity. Attendance at weight loss groups helps some individuals.

Obesity should be managed in an appropriate setting by staff who have been trained in the management of obesity; the individual should receive advice on diet and lifestyle modification and be monitored for changes in weight as well as in blood pressure, blood lipids and other associated conditions.

An anti-obesity drug should be considered only for those with a body mass index (BMI, individual’s bodyweight divided by the square of the individual’s height) of 30 kg/m2 or greater in whom at least 3 months of managed care involving supervised diet, exercise and behaviour modification fails to achieve a realistic reduction in weight. In the presence of associated risk factors, it may be appropriate to prescribe an anti-obesity drug to individuals with a BMI of 28 kg/m2 or greater. Drugs should never be used as the sole element of treatment. The individual should be monitored on a regular basis; drug treatment should be discontinued if the individual regains weight at any time whilst receiving drug treatment.

Combination therapy involving more than one anti-obesity drug is contra-indicated by the manufacturers; there is no evidence-base to support such treatment.

Thyroid hormones have no place in the treatment of obesity except in biochemically proven hypothyroid patients. The use of diuretics, chorionic gonadotrophin, or amfetamines is not appropriate for weight reduction.

Anti-obesity drugs acting on the gastro-intestinal tract

Orlistat should be used in conjunction with other lifestyle measures to manage obesity; treatment should only be continued beyond 12 months after discussing potential benefits and risks with the patient. On stopping orlistat, there may be a gradual reversal of weight loss.

Some of the weight loss in those taking orlistat probably results from individuals reducing their fat intake to avoid severe gastro-intestinal effects including steatorrhoea.

Methylcellulose is claimed to reduce food intake by producing a feeling of satiety, but there is little evidence to support its use in the management of obesity.

Centrally acting appetite suppressants

Phentermine and diethylpropion are central stimulants; they are not recommended for the treatment of obesity. Phentermine has been associated with a risk of pulmonary hypertension.

Sibutramine, dexfenfluramine, and fenfluramine have been withdrawn because the benefit of treatment does not outweigh the risk of serious adverse effects.

Prostaglandins and oxytocics are used to induce abortion or induce or augment labour and to minimise blood loss from the placental site. They include oxytocin, carbetocin, ergometrine maleate, and the prostaglandins. All induce uterine contractions with varying degrees of pain according to the strength of contractions induced.

Induction of abortion

Gemeprost, a prostaglandin administered vaginally as pessaries, is suitable for the medical induction of late therapeutic abortion; gemeprost is also used to ripen the cervix before surgical abortion, particularly in primigravidas. The prostaglandin misoprostol is given by mouth, buccally, sublingually, or vaginally, to induce medical abortion [unlicensed indication]; intravaginal use ripens the cervix before surgical abortion [unlicensed indication]. Extra-amniotic dinoprostone is rarely used nowadays.

Pre-treatment with mifepristone can facilitate the process of medical abortion. It sensitises the uterus to subsequent administration of a prostaglandin and, therefore, abortion occurs in a shorter time and with a lower dose of prostaglandin.

Induction and augmentation of labour

Dinoprostone is available as vaginal tablets, pessaries and vaginal gels for the induction of labour. The intravenous solution is rarely used; it is associated with more side-effects.

Oxytocin (Syntocinon) is administered by slow intravenous infusion, using an infusion pump, to induce or augment labour, usually in conjunction with amniotomy. Uterine activity must be monitored carefully and hyperstimulation avoided. Large doses of oxytocin may result in excessive fluid retention.

Misoprostol is given orally or vaginally for the induction of labour [unlicensed indication].

NICE Guidance, Induction of labour (updated July 2008), available at www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG70.

Prevention and treatment of haemorrhage

Bleeding due to incomplete miscarriage or abortion can be controlled with ergometrine maleate and oxytocin (Syntometrine) given intramuscularly, the dose is adjusted according to the patient’s condition and blood loss. This is commonly used before surgical evacuation of the uterus, particularly when surgery is delayed. Oxytocin and ergometrine maleate combined are more effective in early pregnancy than either drug alone.

Active management of the third stage of labour reduces the risk of postpartum haemorrhage; oxytocin is given by intramuscular injection [unlicensed] on delivery of the anterior shoulder or, at the latest, immediately after the baby is delivered. Alternatively, ergometrine maleate with oxytocin (Syntometrine ) can be given by intramuscular injection in the absence of hypertension; oxytocin alone causes less nausea, vomiting, and hypertension than when given with ergometrine maleate.

In excessive uterine bleeding, any placental products remaining in the uterus should be removed. Oxytocic drugs are used to treat postpartum haemorrhage caused by uterine atony; treatment options are as follows:

oxytocin by slow intravenous injection, followed in severe cases by intravenous infusion of oxytocin at a rate that controls uterine atony orergometrine by intramuscular injection orergometrine by slow intravenous injection (use with caution—risk of hypertension) orergometrine with oxytocin (Syntometrine ) by intramuscular injectionCarboprost has an important role in severe postpartum haemorrhage unresponsive to ergometrine maleate and oxytocin.

Misoprostol [unlicensed] can be used in postpartum haemorrhage when oxytocin, ergometrine maleate, and carboprost are not available or are inappropriate.

Mifepristone

For termination of pregnancy, a single dose of mifepristone is followed by administration of a prostaglandin (gemeprost or misoprostol [unlicensed]).

Guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (November 2011) include [unlicensed] regimens for inducing medical abortion.

Myometrial relaxants

Tocolytic drugs postpone premature labour and they are used with the aim of reducing harm to the child. However, there is no satisfactory evidence that the use of these drugs reduces mortality. The greatest benefit is gained by using the delay to administer corticosteroid therapy or to implement other measures which improve perinatal health (including transfer to a unit with neonatal intensive care facility).

The oxytocin receptor antagonist, atosiban, is licensed for the inhibition of uncomplicated premature labour between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. Atosiban may be preferable to a beta2 agonist because it has fewer side effects. The dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker nifedipine also has fewer side-effects than a beta2 agonist.

The beta2 agonists salbutamol and terbutaline sulfate are licensed for inhibiting uncomplicated premature labour between 22 and 37 weeks of gestation to permit a delay in delivery of up to 48 hours. Use of high-dose short acting beta2 agonists in obstetric indications has been associated with serious, sometimes fatal cardiovascular events in the mother and fetus, particularly when used for a prolonged period of time. Oral therapy is no longer recommended and parenteral therapy should be restricted to a maximum duration of 48 hours, given under the supervision of a specialist, and with close monitoring.

Indometacin, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, also inhibits labour [unlicensed indication] and it can be useful in situations where a beta2 agonist is not appropriate; however, there are concerns about neonatal complications such as transient impairment of renal function and premature closure of ductus arteriosus.

The main use of anticoagulants is to prevent thrombus formation or extension of an existing thrombus in the slower-moving venous side of the circulation, where the thrombus consists of a fibrin web enmeshed with platelets and red cells.

Anticoagulants are of less use in preventing thrombus formation in arteries, for in faster-flowing vessels thrombi are composed mainly of platelets with little fibrin.

Coumarins and phenindione

The oral anticoagulants warfarin sodium, acenocoumarol and phenindione, antagonise the effects of vitamin K, and take at least 48 to 72 hours for the anticoagulant effect to develop fully; warfarin sodium is the drug of choice. If an immediate effect is required, unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin must be given concomitantly.

These oral anticoagulants should not be used in cerebral artery thrombosis or peripheral artery occlusion as first-line therapy; aspirin is more appropriate for reduction of risk in transient ischaemic attacks. Unfractionated or a low molecular weight heparin (see under Parenteral anticoagulants) is usually preferred for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing surgery; alternatively, warfarin sodium can be continued in selected patients currently taking long-term warfarin sodium and who are at high risk of thromboembolism (seek expert advice).

Dose

The base-line prothrombin time should be determined but the initial dose should not be delayed whilst awaiting the result.

Target INR

The following indications and target INRs for adults for warfarin take into account recommendations of the British Society for Haematology guidelines on oral anticoagulation with warfarin—fourth edition. Br J Haematol 2011; 154: 311–324:

An INR which is within 0.5 units of the target value is generally satisfactory; larger deviations require dosage adjustment. Target values (rather than ranges) are now recommended.

the recommended target INR depends on the type and location of the valve, and patient-related risk factorsconsider increasing the INR target or adding an antiplatelet drug, if an embolic event occurs whilst anticoagulated at the target INR.Duration

The risks of thromboembolism recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding should be considered when deciding the duration of anticoagulation.

The following durations of warfarin sodium for the treatment of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism reflect the recommendations of the British Society for Haematology (Guidelines on Oral Anticoagulation with Warfarin—fourth edition. Br J Haematol 2011; 154: 311–324):

6 weeks for isolated calf-vein deep-vein thrombosis3 months for venous thromboembolism provoked by surgery or other transient risk factor (e.g. combined oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, plaster cast)at least 3 months for unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; long-term anticoagulation may be required.Haemorrhage

The main adverse effect of all oral anticoagulants is haemorrhage. Checking the INR and omitting doses when appropriate is essential; if the anticoagulant is stopped but not reversed, the INR should be measured 2–3 days later to ensure that it is falling. The cause of an elevated INR should be investigated. The following recommendations (which take into account the recommendations of the British Society for Haematology Guidelines on Oral Anticoagulation with Warfarin—fourth edition. Br J Haematol 2011; 154: 311–324) are based on the result of the INR and whether there is major or minor bleeding; the recommendations apply to adults taking warfarin:

Major bleeding—stop warfarin sodium; give phytomenadione (vitamin K1) by slow intravenous injection; give dried prothrombin complex (factors II, VII, IX, and X); if dried prothrombin complex unavailable, fresh frozen plasma can be given but is less effective; recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for emergency anticoagulation reversalINR >8.0, minor bleeding—stop warfarin sodium; give phytomenadione (vitamin K1) by slow intravenous injection; repeat dose of phytomenadione if INR still too high after 24 hours; restart warfarin sodium when INR <5.0INR >8.0, no bleeding—stop warfarin sodium; give phytomenadione (vitamin K1) by mouth using the intravenous preparation orally [unlicensed use]; repeat dose of phytomenadione if INR still too high after 24 hours; restart warfarin when INR <5.0INR 5.0–8.0, minor bleeding—stop warfarin sodium; give phytomenadione (vitamin K1) by slow intravenous injection; restart warfarin sodium when INR <5.0INR 5.0–8.0, no bleeding—withhold 1 or 2 doses of warfarin sodium and reduce subsequent maintenance doseUnexpected bleeding at therapeutic levels—always investigate possibility of underlying cause e.g. unsuspected renal or gastro-intestinal tract pathologyPeri-operative anticoagulation

Warfarin sodium should usually be stopped 5 days before elective surgery; phytomenadione (vitamin K1) by mouth (using the intravenous preparation orally [unlicensed use]) should be given the day before surgery if the INR is ≥1.5. If haemostasis is adequate, warfarin sodium can be resumed at the normal maintenance dose on the evening of surgery or the next day.

Patients stopping warfarin sodium prior to surgery who are considered to be at high risk of thromboembolism (e.g. those with a venous thromboembolic event within the last 3 months, atrial fibrillation with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or mitral mechanical heart valve) may require interim therapy (‘bridging’) with a low molecular weight heparin (using treatment dose). The low molecular weight heparin should be stopped at least 24 hours before surgery; if the surgery carries a high risk of bleeding, the low molecular weight heparin should not be restarted until at least 48 hours after surgery.

Patients on warfarin sodium who require emergency surgery that can be delayed for 6–12 hours can be given intravenous phytomenadione (vitamin K1) to reverse the anticoagulant effect. If surgery cannot be delayed, dried prothrombin complex can be given in addition to intravenous phytomenadione (vitamin K1) and the INR checked before surgery.

Combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy

Existing antiplatelet therapy following an acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention should be continued for the necessary duration according to the indication being treated. The addition of warfarin sodium, when indicated (e.g. for venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation) should be considered following an assessment of the patient’s risk of bleeding and discussion with a cardiologist. The duration of treatment with dual therapy (e.g. aspirin and warfarin sodium) or triple therapy (e.g. aspirin with clopidogrel and warfarin sodium) should be kept to a minimum where possible. The risk of bleeding with aspirin and warfarin sodium dual therapy is lower than with clopidogrel and warfarin sodium Depending on the indications being treated and the patient’s risk of thromboembolism, it may be possible to withhold antiplatelet therapy until warfarin sodium therapy is complete, or vice versa (on specialist advice) in order to reduce the length of time on dual or triple therapy.

    <p>Antibacterial drugs should only be prescribed for the <i>treatment</i> of oral infections on the basis of defined need. They may be used in conjunction with (but not as an alternative to) other appropriate measures, such as providing drainage or extracting a tooth.</p>
    <p>The ‘blind’ prescribing of an antibacterial for unexplained pyrexia, cervical lymphadenopathy, or facial swelling can lead to difficulty in establishing the diagnosis. In severe oral infections, a sample should always be taken for bacteriology.</p>
    <p>Oral infections which may require antibacterial treatment include acute periapical or periodontal abscess, cellulitis, acutely created oral-antral communication (and acute sinusitis), severe pericoronitis, localised osteitis, acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis, and destructive forms of chronic periodontal disease. Most of these infections are readily resolved by the early establishment of drainage and removal of the cause (typically an infected necrotic pulp). Antibacterials may be required if treatment has to be delayed, in immunocompromised patients, or in those with conditions such as diabetes or Paget’s disease. Certain rarer infections including bacterial sialadenitis, osteomyelitis, actinomycosis, and infections involving fascial spaces such as Ludwig’s angina, require antibiotics and specialist hospital care.</p>
    <p>Antibacterial drugs may also be useful after dental surgery in some cases of spreading infection. Infection may spread to involve local lymph nodes, to fascial spaces (where it can cause airway obstruction), or into the bloodstream (where it can lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis and other serious complications). Extension of an infection can also lead to maxillary sinusitis; osteomyelitis is a complication, which usually arises when host resistance is reduced.</p>
    <p>If the oral infection fails to respond to antibacterial treatment within 48 hours the antibacterial should be changed, preferably on the basis of bacteriological investigation. Failure to respond may also suggest an incorrect diagnosis, lack of essential additional measures (such as drainage), poor host resistance, or poor patient compliance.</p>

If the oral infection fails to respond to antibacterial treatment within 48 hours the antibacterial should be changed, preferably on the basis of bacteriological investigation. Failure to respond may also suggest an incorrect diagnosis, lack of essential additional measures (such as drainage), poor host resistance, or poor patient compliance.

Combination of a penicillin (or a macrolide) with metronidazole may sometimes be helpful for the treatment of severe oral infections or oral infections that have not responded to initial antibacterial treatment.

Penicillins

Phenoxymethylpenicillin is effective for dentoalveolar abscess.

Broad-spectrum penicillins

Amoxicillin is as effective as phenoxymethylpenicillin but is better absorbed; however, it may encourage emergence of resistant organisms.

Like phenoxymethylpenicillin, amoxicillin is ineffective against bacteria that produce beta-lactamases.

Amoxicillin may be useful for short course oral regimens.

Co-amoxiclav is active against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin. Co-amoxiclav may be used for severe dental infection with spreading cellulitis or dental infection not responding to first-line antibacterial treatment.

Cephalosporins

The cephalosporins offer little advantage over the penicillins in dental infections, often being less active against anaerobes. Infections due to oral streptococci (often termed viridans streptococci) which become resistant to penicillin are usually also resistant to cephalosporins. This is of importance in the case of patients who have had rheumatic fever and are on long-term penicillin therapy. Cefalexin and cefradine have been used in the treatment of oral infections.

Tetracyclines

In adults, tetracyclines can be effective against oral anaerobes but the development of resistance (especially by oral streptococci) has reduced their usefulness for the treatment of acute oral infections; they may still have a role in the treatment of destructive (refractory) forms of periodontal disease. Doxycycline has a longer duration of action than tetracycline or oxytetracycline and need only be given once daily; it is reported to be more active against anaerobes than some other tetracyclines.

Doxycycline may have a role in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulceration, or as an adjunct to gingival scaling and root planing for periodontitis.

Macrolides

The macrolides are an alternative for oral infections in penicillin-allergic patients or where a beta-lactamase producing organism is involved. However, many organisms are now resistant to macrolides or rapidly develop resistance; their use should therefore be limited to short courses.

Clindamycin

Clindamycin should not be used routinely for the treatment of oral infections because it may be no more effective than penicillins against anaerobes and there may be cross-resistance with erythromycin-resistant bacteria. Clindamycin can be used for the treatment of dentoalveolar abscess that has not responded to penicillin or to metronidazole.

Metronidazole and tinidazole

Metronidazole is an alternative to a penicillin for the treatment of many oral infections where the patient is allergic to penicillin or the infection is due to beta-lactamase-producing anaerobes. It is the drug of first choice for the treatment of acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (Vincent’s infection) and pericoronitis; amoxicillin is a suitable alternative. For these purposes metronidazole for 3 days is sufficient, but the duration of treatment may need to be longer in pericoronitis. Tinidazole is licensed for the treatment of acute ulcerative gingivitis.

    <p>Ulceration of the oral mucosa may be caused by trauma (physical or chemical), recurrent aphthae, infections, carcinoma, dermatological disorders, nutritional deficiencies, gastro-intestinal disease, haematopoietic disorders, and drug therapy (see also <i>Chemotherapy induced mucositis and myelosuppression</i> under <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"treatment-summary/cytotoxic-drugs.xml\" type=\"bookmark\" rel=\"treatmentsummary\" bnfid=\"PHP78537\">Cytotoxic drugs</xref>). It is important to establish the diagnosis in each case as the majority of these lesions require specific management in addition to local treatment. Local treatment aims to protect the ulcerated area, to relieve pain, to reduce inflammation, or to control secondary infection. Patients with an unexplained mouth ulcer of more than 3 weeks’ duration require urgent referral to hospital to exclude oral cancer.</p>

Ulceration of the oral mucosa may be caused by trauma (physical or chemical), recurrent aphthae, infections, carcinoma, dermatological disorders, nutritional deficiencies, gastro-intestinal disease, haematopoietic disorders, and drug therapy (see also Chemotherapy induced mucositis and myelosuppression under Cytotoxic drugs). It is important to establish the diagnosis in each case as the majority of these lesions require specific management in addition to local treatment. Local treatment aims to protect the ulcerated area, to relieve pain, to reduce inflammation, or to control secondary infection. Patients with an unexplained mouth ulcer of more than 3 weeks’ duration require urgent referral to hospital to exclude oral cancer.

Simple mouthwashes

A saline mouthwash may relieve the pain of traumatic ulceration. The mouthwash is made up with warm water and used at frequent intervals until the discomfort and swelling subsides.

Antiseptic mouthwashes

Secondary bacterial infection may be a feature of any mucosal ulceration; it can increase discomfort and delay healing. Use of a chlorhexidine mouthwash is often beneficial and may accelerate healing of recurrent aphthae.

Corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroid therapy may be used for some forms of oral ulceration. In the case of aphthous ulcers it is most effective if applied in the ‘prodromal’ phase.

Thrush or other types of candidiasis are recognised complications of corticosteroid treatment.

Hydrocortisoneoromucosal tablets are allowed to dissolve next to an ulcer and are useful in recurrent aphthae and erosive lichenoid lesions.

Beclometasone dipropionate inhaler sprayed on the oral mucosa is used to manage oral ulceration [unlicensed indication]. Alternatively, betamethasone soluble tablets dissolved in water can be used as a mouthwash to treat oral ulceration [unlicensed indication].

Systemic corticosteroid therapy ( see under Corticosteroids, inflammatory disorders), is reserved for severe conditions such as pemphigus vulgaris.

Local analgesics

Local analgesics have a limited role in the management of oral ulceration. When applied topically their action is of a relatively short duration so that analgesia cannot be maintained continuously throughout the day. The main indication for a topical local analgesic is to relieve the pain of otherwise intractable oral ulceration particularly when it is due to major aphthae. For this purpose lidocaine hydrochloride 5% ointment or lozenges containing a local anaesthetic are applied to the ulcer. Lidocaine hydrochloride 10% solution as spray can be applied thinly to the ulcer [unlicensed indication] using a cotton bud. When local anaesthetics are used in the mouth care must be taken not to produce anaesthesia of the pharynx before meals as this might lead to choking.

Preparations on sale to the public: many mouth ulcer preparations, throat lozenges, and throat sprays on sale to the public contain a local anaesthetic. To identify the active ingredients in such preparations, consult the product literature of the manufacturer— the correct proprietary name should be ascertained as many products have very similar names but different active ingredients.

Benzydamine hydrochloride and flurbiprofen are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Benzydamine hydrochloride mouthwash or spray may be useful in reducing the discomfort associated with a variety of ulcerative conditions. It has also been found to be effective in reducing the discomfort of tonsillectomy and post-irradiation mucositis. Some patients find the full-strength mouthwash causes some stinging and, for them, it should be diluted with an equal volume of water. Flurbiprofen lozenges are licensed for the relief of sore throat.

Choline salicylate is a derivative of salicylic acid and has some analgesic action. The dental gel may provide relief for recurrent aphthae, but excessive application or confinement under a denture irritates the mucosa and can itself cause ulceration.

Other preparations

Doxycycline rinsed in the mouth may be of value for recurrent aphthous ulceration.

Periodontitis

Low-dose doxycycline (Periostat) is licensed as an adjunct to scaling and root planing for the treatment of periodontitis; a low dose of doxycycline reduces collagenase activity without inhibiting bacteria associated with periodontitis.

 For anti-infectives used in the treatment of destructive (refractory) forms of periodontal disease, see under Oropharyngeal bacterial infections. See also Mouthwashes and other preparations for oropharyngeal use for mouthwashes used for oral hygiene and plaque inhibition.

Fungal infections of the mouth are usually caused by Candida spp. (candidiasis or candidosis). Different types of oropharyngeal candidiasis are managed as follows:

Thrush

Acute pseudomembranous candidiasis (thrush), is usually an acute infection but it may persist for months in patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids, cytotoxics or broad-spectrum antibacterials. Thrush also occurs in patients with serious systemic disease associated with reduced immunity such as leukaemia, other malignancies, and HIV infection. Any predisposing condition should be managed appropriately. When thrush is associated with corticosteroid inhalers, rinsing the mouth with water (or cleaning a child’s teeth) immediately after using the inhaler may avoid the problem. Treatment with nystatin or miconazole may be needed. Fluconazole is effective for unresponsive infections or if a topical antifungal drug cannot be used or if the patient has dry mouth. Topical therapy may not be adequate in immunocompromised patients and an oral triazole antifungal is preferred.

Acute erythematous candidiasis

Acute erythematous (atrophic) candidiasis is a relatively uncommon condition associated with corticosteroid and broad-spectrum antibacterial use and with HIV disease. It is usually treated with fluconazole.

Denture stomatitis

Patients with denture stomatitis (chronic atrophic candidiasis), should cleanse their dentures thoroughly and leave them out as often as possible during the treatment period. To prevent recurrence of the problem, dentures should not normally be worn at night. New dentures may be required if these measures fail despite good compliance.

Miconazole oral gel can be applied to the fitting surface of the denture before insertion (for short periods only). Denture stomatitis is not always associated with candidiasis and other factors such as mechanical or chemical irritation, bacterial infection, or rarely allergy to the dental base material, may be the cause.

Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis

Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis (candidal leucoplakia) carries an increased risk of malignancy; biopsy is essential—this type of candidiasis may be associated with varying degrees of dysplasia, with oral cancer present in a high proportion of cases. Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis is treated with a systemic antifungal such as fluconazole to eliminate candidal overlay. Patients should avoid the use of tobacco.

Angular cheilitis

Angular cheilitis (angular stomatitis) is characterised by soreness, erythema and fissuring at the angles of the mouth. It is commonly associated with denture stomatitis but may represent a nutritional deficiency or it may be related to orofacial granulomatosis or HIV infection. Both yeasts (Candida spp.) and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci) are commonly involved as interacting, infective factors. A reduction in facial height related to ageing and tooth loss with maceration in the deep occlusive folds that may subsequently arise, predisposes to such infection. While the underlying cause is being identified and treated, it is often helpful to apply miconazole cream or fusidic acid ointment; if the angular cheilitis is unresponsive to treatment, hydrocortisone with miconazole cream or ointment can be used.

Immunocompromised patients

See advice on prevention of fungal infections in Immunocompromised patients under Antifungals, systemic use.

Drugs used in oropharyngeal candidiasis

Nystatin is not absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and is applied locally (as a suspension) to the mouth for treating local fungal infections. Miconazole is applied locally (as an oral gel) in the mouth but it is absorbed to the extent that potential interactions need to be considered. Miconazole also has some activity against Gram-positive bacteria including streptococci and staphylococci. Fluconazole is given by mouth for infections that do not respond to topical therapy or when topical therapy cannot be used. It is reliably absorbed and effective. Itraconazole can be used for fluconazole-resistant infections.

If candidal infection fails to respond to 1 to 2 weeks of treatment with antifungal drugs the patient should be sent for investigation to eliminate the possibility of underlying disease. Persistent infection may also be caused by reinfection from the genito-urinary or gastro-intestinal tract. Infection can be eliminated from these sources by appropriate anticandidal therapy; the patient’s partner may also require treatment to prevent reinfection.

Antiseptic mouthwashes are used in the prevention of oral candidiasis in immunocompromised patients and in the treatment of denture stomatitis.

    <p>Oxygen should be regarded as a drug. It is prescribed for hypoxaemic patients to increase alveolar oxygen tension and decrease the work of breathing. The concentration of oxygen required depends on the condition being treated; the administration of an inappropriate concentration of oxygen can have serious or even fatal consequences.</p>
    <p>Oxygen is probably the most common drug used in medical emergencies. It should be prescribed initially to achieve a normal or near–normal oxygen saturation; in most acutely ill patients with a normal or low arterial carbon dioxide (<i>P</i><sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), oxygen saturation should be 94–98% oxygen saturation. However, in some clinical situations such as cardiac arrest and carbon monoxide poisoning it is more appropriate to aim for the highest possible oxygen saturation until the patient is stable. A lower target of 88–92% oxygen saturation is indicated for patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure.</p>
    <p>
      <i>High concentration oxygen therapy</i> is safe in uncomplicated cases of conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary fibrosis, shock, severe trauma, sepsis, or anaphylaxis. In such conditions low arterial oxygen (<i>P</i><sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is usually associated with low or normal arterial carbon dioxide (<i>P</i><sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), and therefore there is little risk of hypoventilation and carbon dioxide retention.</p>
    <p>In acute severe asthma, the arterial carbon dioxide (<i>P</i><sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) is usually subnormal but as asthma deteriorates it may rise steeply (particularly in children). These patients usually require high concentrations of oxygen and if the arterial carbon dioxide (<i>P</i><sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) remains high despite other treatment, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation needs to be considered urgently.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Low concentration oxygen therapy</i> (controlled oxygen therapy) is reserved for patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, which is more likely in those with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;</li>
      <li>advanced cystic fibrosis;</li>
      <li>severe non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis;</li>
      <li>severe kyphoscoliosis or severe ankylosing spondylitis;</li>
      <li>severe lung scarring caused by tuberculosis;</li>
      <li>musculoskeletal disorders with respiratory weakness, especially if on home ventilation;</li>
      <li>an overdose of opioids, benzodiazepines, or other drugs causing respiratory depression.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Until blood gases can be measured, initial oxygen should be given using a controlled concentration of 28% or less, titrated towards a target oxygen saturation of 88–92%. The aim is to provide the patient with enough oxygen to achieve an acceptable arterial oxygen tension without worsening carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis. Patients may carry an <i>oxygen alert card</i>.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Domiciliary oxygen</p>
      <p>Oxygen should only be prescribed for use in the home after careful evaluation in hospital by respiratory experts.

    <p>Assessment for long-term oxygen therapy requires measurement of arterial blood gas tensions.

The main use of anticoagulants is to prevent thrombus formation or extension of an existing thrombus in the slower-moving venous side of the circulation, where the thrombus consists of a fibrin web enmeshed with platelets and red cells.

Anticoagulants are of less use in preventing thrombus formation in arteries, for in faster-flowing vessels thrombi are composed mainly of platelets with little fibrin.

Heparin

Heparin initiates anticoagulation rapidly but has a short duration of action. It is often referred to as ‘standard’ or heparin (unfractionated) to distinguish it from the low molecular weight heparins, which have a longer duration of action. Although a low molecular weight heparin is generally preferred for routine use, heparin (unfractionated) can be used in those at high risk of bleeding because its effect can be terminated rapidly by stopping the infusion.

Low molecular weight heparins

Low molecular weight heparins (dalteparin sodium, enoxaparin sodium, and tinzaparin sodium) are usually preferred over heparin (unfractionated) in the prevention of Venous thromboembolism because they are as effective and they have a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The standard prophylactic regimen does not require anticoagulant monitoring. The duration of action of low molecular weight heparins is longer than that of heparin (unfractionated) and once-daily subcutaneous administration is possible for some indications, making them convenient to use.

Low molecular weight heparins are generally preferred over heparin (unfractionated) in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and are also used in the treatment of myocardial infarction, unstable coronary artery disease (see under Acute coronary syndromes) and for the prevention of clotting in extracorporeal circuits.

Dalteparin sodium and tinzaparin sodium (only 20 000 unit/mL syringe) are also licensed for the extended treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with solid tumours; treatment is recommended for a duration of 6 months. Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Heparinoids

Danaparoid sodium is a heparinoid used for prophylaxis of deep-vein thrombosis in patients undergoing general or orthopaedic surgery. Providing there is no evidence of cross-reactivity, it also has a role in patients who develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Argatroban

An oral anticoagulant can be given with argatroban monohydrate, but it should only be started once thrombocytopenia has substantially resolved.

Hirudins

Bivalirudin, a hirudin analogue, is a thrombin inhibitor which is licensed for unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in patients planned for urgent or early intervention, and as an anticoagulant for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention—see also Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Acute coronary syndromes).

Heparin flushes

The use of heparin flushes should be kept to a minimum. For maintaining patency of peripheral venous catheters, sodium chloride injection 0.9% is as effective as heparin flushes. The role of heparin flushes in maintaining patency of arterial and central venous catheters is unclear.

Epoprostenol

Epoprostenol (prostacyclin) can be given to inhibit platelet aggregation during renal dialysis when heparins are unsuitable or contra-indicated. It is also licensed for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension resistant to other treatment, usually with oral anticoagulation; it should be initiated by specialists in pulmonary hypertension. Epoprostenol is a potent vasodilator. It has a short half-life of approximately 3 minutes and therefore it must be administered by continuous intravenous infusion.

Fondaparinux

Fondaparinux sodium is a synthetic pentasaccharide that inhibits activated factor X.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Parkinson's disease</p>
    <p>In idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, the progressive degeneration of pigmented neurones in the substantia nigra leads to a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The resulting neurochemical imbalance in the basal ganglia causes the characteristic signs and symptoms of the illness. Drug therapy does not prevent disease progression, but it improves most patients’ quality of life.</p>
    <p>Patients with suspected Parkinson’s disease should be referred to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis; the diagnosis should be reviewed every 6–12 months.</p>
    <p>Features resembling those of Parkinson’s disease can occur in diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy, but they do not normally show a sustained response to the drugs used in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.</p>
    <p>When initiating treatment, patients should be advised about its limitations and possible side-effects. About 5–10% of patients with Parkinson’s disease respond poorly to treatment.</p>
    <p>Treatment is usually not started until symptoms cause significant disruption of daily activities. <b>Levodopa</b>, <b>non-ergot-derived dopamine-receptor agonists</b>, or <b>monoamine-oxidase-B inhibitors</b> can be prescribed for initial treatment in early Parkinson’s disease. Therapy with two or more antiparkinsonian drugs may be necessary as the disease progresses. Most patients eventually require levodopa and subsequently develop motor complications.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Elderly</p>

      <p>When used alone, dopamine-receptor agonists cause fewer motor complications in long-term treatment compared with levodopa treatment but the overall motor performance improves slightly less. The dopamine-receptor agonists are associated with more psychiatric side-effects than levodopa.</p>
      <p>Dopamine-receptor agonists are also used with levodopa in more advanced disease. If a dopamine-receptor agonist is added to levodopa therapy, the dose of levodopa needs to be reduced.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/apomorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3063\">Apomorphine hydrochloride</xref> is a potent dopamine-receptor agonist that is sometimes helpful in advanced disease for patients experiencing unpredictable ‘off’ periods with levodopa treatment. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/apomorphine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3063\">Apomorphine hydrochloride</xref> should be initiated in a specialist clinic.

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Levodopa</p>
      <p>
        <b>Levodopa</b>, the amino-acid precursor of dopamine, acts by replenishing depleted striatal dopamine. It is given with an extracerebral <b>dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor</b>, which reduces the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, thereby limiting side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, and cardiovascular effects; additionally, effective brain-dopamine concentrations are achieved with lower doses of levodopa. The extracerebral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors used with levodopa are benserazide (in <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-beneldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3093\">co-beneldopa</xref>) and carbidopa (in <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-careldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3098\">co-careldopa</xref>).</p>
      <p>Levodopa, in combination with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor, is useful in the elderly or frail, in patients with other significant illnesses, and in those with more severe symptoms. It is effective and well tolerated in the majority of patients.</p>
      <p>Levodopa therapy should be initiated at a low dose and increased in small steps; the final dose should be as low as possible. Intervals between doses should be chosen to suit the needs of the individual patient.</p>
      <p>Nausea and vomiting with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-beneldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3093\">co-beneldopa</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-careldopa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3098\">co-careldopa</xref> are rarely dose-limiting and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/domperidone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2544\">domperidone</xref> can be useful in controlling these effects.</p>
      <p>Levodopa treatment is associated with potentially troublesome motor complications including response fluctuations and dyskinesias. Response fluctuations are characterised by large variations in motor performance, with normal function during the ‘on’ period, and weakness and restricted mobility during the ‘off’ period. ‘End-of-dose’ deterioration with progressively shorter duration of benefit also occurs. Modified-release preparations may help with ‘end-of-dose’ deterioration or nocturnal immobility and rigidity. Motor complications are particularly problematic in young patients treated with levodopa.</p>

In idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, the progressive degeneration of pigmented neurones in the substantia nigra leads to a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The resulting neurochemical imbalance in the basal ganglia causes the characteristic signs and symptoms of the illness. Drug therapy does not prevent disease progression, but it improves most patients’ quality of life.

Patients with suspected Parkinson’s disease should be referred to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis; the diagnosis should be reviewed every 6–12 months.

Features resembling those of Parkinson’s disease can occur in diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy, but they do not normally show a sustained response to the drugs used in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.

When initiating treatment, patients should be advised about its limitations and possible side-effects. About 5–10% of patients with Parkinson’s disease respond poorly to treatment.

Treatment is usually not started until symptoms cause significant disruption of daily activities. Levodopa, non-ergot-derived dopamine-receptor agonists, or monoamine-oxidase-B inhibitors can be prescribed for initial treatment in early Parkinson’s disease. Therapy with two or more antiparkinsonian drugs may be necessary as the disease progresses. Most patients eventually require levodopa and subsequently develop motor complications.

Elderly

Antiparkinsonian drugs can cause confusion in the elderly. It is particularly important to initiate treatment with low doses and to increase the dose gradually.

Dopaminergic drugs used in Parkinson’s disease

Dopamine-receptor agonists

The dopamine-receptor agonists have a direct action on dopamine receptors. Initial treatment of Parkinson’s disease is often with the dopamine-receptor agonists pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine. The ergot-derived dopamine-receptor agonists bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide are rarely used because the risk of fibrotic reactions.

When used alone, dopamine-receptor agonists cause fewer motor complications in long-term treatment compared with levodopa treatment but the overall motor performance improves slightly less. The dopamine-receptor agonists are associated with more psychiatric side-effects than levodopa.

Dopamine-receptor agonists are also used with levodopa in more advanced disease. If a dopamine-receptor agonist is added to levodopa therapy, the dose of levodopa needs to be reduced.

Apomorphine hydrochloride is a potent dopamine-receptor agonist that is sometimes helpful in advanced disease for patients experiencing unpredictable ‘off’ periods with levodopa treatment. Apomorphine hydrochloride should be initiated in a specialist clinic. After an overnight withdrawal of oral antiparkinsonian medication to induce an ‘off’ episode, the threshold dose of apomorphine hydrochloride is determined. Oral antiparkinsonian medication is then restarted. The patient must be taught to self-administer apomorphine hydrochloride by subcutaneous injection into the lower abdomen or outer thigh at the first sign of an ‘off’ episode. Once treatment has been established it may be possible to gradually reduce other antiparkinsonian medications.

Levodopa

Levodopa, the amino-acid precursor of dopamine, acts by replenishing depleted striatal dopamine. It is given with an extracerebral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor, which reduces the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, thereby limiting side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, and cardiovascular effects; additionally, effective brain-dopamine concentrations are achieved with lower doses of levodopa. The extracerebral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors used with levodopa are benserazide (in co-beneldopa) and carbidopa (in co-careldopa).

Levodopa, in combination with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor, is useful in the elderly or frail, in patients with other significant illnesses, and in those with more severe symptoms. It is effective and well tolerated in the majority of patients.

Levodopa therapy should be initiated at a low dose and increased in small steps; the final dose should be as low as possible. Intervals between doses should be chosen to suit the needs of the individual patient.

Nausea and vomiting with co-beneldopa or co-careldopa are rarely dose-limiting and domperidone can be useful in controlling these effects.

Levodopa treatment is associated with potentially troublesome motor complications including response fluctuations and dyskinesias. Response fluctuations are characterised by large variations in motor performance, with normal function during the ‘on’ period, and weakness and restricted mobility during the ‘off’ period. ‘End-of-dose’ deterioration with progressively shorter duration of benefit also occurs. Modified-release preparations may help with ‘end-of-dose’ deterioration or nocturnal immobility and rigidity. Motor complications are particularly problematic in young patients treated with levodopa.

Monoamine-oxidase-B inhibitors

Rasagiline and selegiline hydrochloride are monoamine-oxidase-B inhibitors used in Parkinson’s disease. Early treatment with selegiline hydrochloride alone can delay the need for levodopa therapy.

Antimuscarinic drugs used in parkinsonism

Antimuscarinic drugs can be useful in drug-induced parkinsonism, but they are generally not used in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease because they are less effective than dopaminergic drugs and they are associated with cognitive impairment.

The antimuscarinic drugs orphenadrine hydrochloride, procyclidine hydrochloride, and trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride reduce the symptoms of parkinsonism induced by antipsychotic drugs, but there is no justification for giving them routinely in the absence of parkinsonian side-effects. Tardive dyskinesia is not improved by antimuscarinic drugs and may be made worse.

In idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, antimuscarinic drugs reduce tremor and rigidity but they have little effect on bradykinesia. They may be useful in reducing sialorrhoea.

There are no important differences between the antimuscarinic drugs, but some patients tolerate one better than another.

Procyclidine hydrochloride can be given parenterally and is effective emergency treatment for acute drug-induced dystonic reactions.

If treatment with an antimuscarinic is ineffective, intravenous diazepam can be given for life-threatening acute drug-induced dystonic reactions.

Drugs used in essential tremor, chorea, tics, and related disorders

Tetrabenazine is mainly used to control movement disorders in Huntington’s chorea and related disorders. Tetrabenazine can also be prescribed for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia if switching or withdrawing the causative antipsychotic drug is not effective. It acts by depleting nerve endings of dopamine. It is effective in only a proportion of patients and its use may be limited by the development of depression.

Haloperidol [unlicensed indication], olanzapine [unlicensed indication], risperidone [unlicensed indication], and quetiapine [unlicensed indication], can also be used to suppress chorea in Huntington’s disease.

Haloperidol can also improve motor tics and symptoms of Tourette syndrome and related choreas. Other treatments for Tourette syndrome include pimozide [unlicensed indication] (important: ECG monitoring required), clonidine hydrochloride [unlicensed indication], and sulpiride [unlicensed indication]. Trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride in high dosage can also improve some movement disorders; it is sometimes necessary to build the dose up over many weeks. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride and haloperidol are used to relieve intractable hiccup.

Propranolol hydrochloride or another beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug may be useful in treating essential tremor or tremors associated with anxiety or thyrotoxicosis.

Primidone in some cases provides relief from benign essential tremor; the dose is increased slowly to reduce side-effects.

Piracetam is used as an adjunctive treatment for myoclonus of cortical origin. After an acute episode, attempts should be made every 6 months to decrease or discontinue treatment.

Riluzole is used to extend life in patients with motor neurone disease who have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Torsion dystonia and other involuntary movements

Treatment with botulinum toxin type A can be considered after an acquired non-progressive brain injury if rapid-onset spasticity causes postural or functional difficulties.

Although benzylpenicillin sodium is effective in the treatment of tetanus, metronidazole is preferred. Benzylpenicillin is inactivated by gastric acid and absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract is low; therefore it must be given by injection.

Benzathine benzylpenicillin is used for the treatment of early syphilis and late latent syphilis; it is given by intramuscular injection.

Phenoxymethylpenicillin (Penicillin V) has a similar antibacterial spectrum to benzylpenicillin sodium, but is less active. It is gastric acid-stable, so is suitable for oral administration. It should not be used for serious infections because absorption can be unpredictable and plasma concentrations variable. It is indicated principally for respiratory-tract infections in children, for streptococcal tonsillitis, and for continuing treatment after one or more injections of benzylpenicillin sodium when clinical response has begun. It should not be used for meningococcal or gonococcal infections. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is used for prophylaxis against streptococcal infections following rheumatic fever and against pneumococcal infections following splenectomy or in sickle-cell disease.

Penicillinase-resistant penicillins

Most staphylococci are now resistant to benzylpenicillin because they produce penicillinases. Flucloxacillin, however, is not inactivated by these enzymes and is thus effective in infections caused by penicillin-resistant staphylococci, which is the sole indication for its use. Flucloxacillin is acid-stable and can, therefore, be given by mouth as well as by injection. Flucloxacillin is well absorbed from the gut.

Temocillin is active against Gram-negative bacteria and is stable against a wide range of beta-lactamases. It should be reserved for the treatment of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacteria, including those resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Temocillin is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp.

Broad-spectrum penicillins

Ampicillin is active against certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms but is inactivated by penicillinases including those produced by Staphylococcus aureus and by common Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli. Almost all staphylococci, approx. 60% of E. coli strains and approx. 20% of Haemophilus influenzae strains are now resistant. The likelihood of resistance should therefore be considered before using ampicillin for the ‘blind’ treatment of infections; in particular, it should not be used for hospital patients without checking sensitivity.

Ampicillin is well excreted in the bile and urine. It is principally indicated for the treatment of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and middle ear infections, both of which may be due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae, and for urinary-tract infections.

Ampicillin can be given by mouth but less than half the dose is absorbed, and absorption is further decreased by the presence of food in the gut.

Maculopapular rashes commonly occur with ampicillin (and amoxicillin) but are not usually related to true penicillin allergy. They almost always occur in patients with glandular fever; broad-spectrum penicillins should not therefore be used for ‘blind’ treatment of a sore throat. The risk of rash is also increased in patients with acute or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or in cytomegalovirus infection.

Amoxicillin is a derivative of ampicillin and has a similar antibacterial spectrum. It is better absorbed than ampicillin when given by mouth, producing higher plasma and tissue concentrations; unlike ampicillin, absorption is not affected by the presence of food in the stomach. Amoxicillin may also be used for the treatment of Lyme disease [not licensed].

Co-amoxiclav consists of amoxicillin with the betalactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. Clavulanic acid itself has no significant antibacterial activity but, by inactivating beta-lactamases, it makes the combination active against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin. These include resistant strains of Staph. aureus, E. coli, and H. influenzae, as well as many Bacteroides and Klebsiella spp. Co-amoxiclav should be reserved for infections likely, or known, to be caused by amoxicillin-resistant beta-lactamase-producing strains.

A combination of ampicillin with flucloxacillin (as co-fluampicil is available to treat infections involving either streptococci or staphylococci (e.g. cellulitis).

Antipseudomonal penicillins

Piperacillin, a ureidopenicillin, is only available in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. Ticarcillin, a carboxypenicillin, is only available in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. Both preparations have a broad spectrum of activity against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobes. Piperacillin with tazobactam has activity against a wider range of Gram-negative organisms than ticarcillin with clavulanic acid and it is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These antibacterials are not active against MRSA. They are used in the treatment of septicaemia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and complicated infections involving the urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, or intra-abdomen. For severe pseudomonas infections these antipseudomonal penicillins can be given with an aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin) since they have a synergistic effect. 

Mecillinams

Pivmecillinam hydrochloride has significant activity against many Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, and salmonellae. It is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci. Pivmecillinam hydrochloride is hydrolysed to mecillinam, which is the active drug.

Healing can be promoted by general measures, stopping smoking and taking antacids and by antisecretory drug treatment, but relapse is common when treatment ceases. Nearly all duodenal ulcers and most gastric ulcers not associated with NSAIDs are caused by Helicobacter pylori.

Acid inhibition combined with antibacterial treatment is highly effective in the eradication of H. pylori ; reinfection is rare. Antibiotic associated colitis is an uncommon risk.

For initial treatment, a one-week triple-therapy regimen that comprises a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and either amoxicillinor metronidazole can be used.

Two-week dual-therapy regimens using a proton pump inhibitor and a single antibacterial are licensed, but produce low rates of H. pylori eradication and are not recommended.

Tinidazole is also used occasionally for H. pylori eradication as an alternative to metronidazole; tinidazole should be combined with antisecretory drugs and other antibacterials.

Routine retesting, to confirm eradication, is not necessary unless the patient has gastric MALT lymphoma or complicated H. pylori associated peptic ulcer.

A two-week regimen comprising a proton pump inhibitor plus tripotassium dicitratobismuthate, plus tetracycline, plusmetronidazole can be used for eradication failure. Alternatively, the patient can be referred for endoscopy and treatment based on the results of culture and sensitivity testing.

See under NSAID-associated ulcers for the role of H. pylori eradication therapy in patients starting or taking a NSAID. Also see Dyspepsia for H. pylori eradication in patients with dyspepsia.

Test for Helicobacter pylori

13C-Urea breath test kits are available for the diagnosis of gastro-duodenal infection with Helicobacter pylori. The test involves collection of breath samples before and after ingestion of an oral solution of 13C-urea; the samples are sent for analysis by an appropriate laboratory. The test should not be performed within 4 weeks of treatment with an antibacterial or within 2 weeks of treatment with an antisecretory drug.

NSAID-associated ulcers

Gastro-intestinal bleeding and ulceration can occur with NSAID use. The risk of serious upper gastro-intestinal side-effects varies between individual NSAIDs. Whenever possible, the NSAID should be withdrawn if an ulcer occurs.

Patients at high risk of developing gastro-intestinal complications with a NSAID include those aged over 65 years, those with a history of peptic ulcer disease or serious gastro-intestinal complication, those taking other medicines that increase the risk of gastro-intestinal side-effects, or those with serious co-morbidity (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal or hepatic impairment). In those at risk of ulceration, a proton pump inhibitor can be considered for protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers associated with non-selective NSAIDs; a H2-receptor antagonist such as ranitidine given at twice the usual dose or misoprostol are alternatives. Colic and diarrhoea may limit the dose of misoprostol. Its use is most appropriate for the frail or very elderly from whom NSAIDs cannot be withdrawn. A combination of a cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor with a proton pump inhibitor may be more appropriate for those with a history of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding or 3 or more risk factors for gastro-intestinal ulceration, but see NSAIDs and Cardiovascular Events.

NSAID use and H. pylori infection are independent risk factors for gastro-intestinal bleeding and ulceration. In patients already taking a NSAID, eradication of H. pylori is unlikely to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced bleeding or ulceration. However, in patients with dyspepsia or a history of gastric or duodenal ulcer, who are H. pylori positive, and who are about to start long-term treatment with a non-selective NSAID, eradication of H. pylori may reduce the overall risk of ulceration.

In a patient who has developed an ulcer, if the NSAID can be discontinued, a proton pump inhibitor usually produces the most rapid healing; alternatively, the ulcer can be treated with a H2-receptor antagonist or misoprostol. On healing, patients should be tested for H. pylori and given eradication therapy if H. pylori is present (see also Test for Helicobacter pylori ).

Since non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not depress respiration, do not impair gastro-intestinal motility, and do not cause dependence, they may be useful alternatives or adjuncts to opioids for the relief of postoperative pain. NSAIDs may be inadequate for the relief of severe pain. Acemetacin, diclofenac sodium, diclofenac potassium, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, paracetamol, parecoxib, and ketorolac trometamol are licensed for postoperative use. Diclofenac and paracetamol can be given by injection as well as by mouth. Diclofenac sodium can be given by intravenous infusion for the treatment or prevention of postoperative pain. Intramuscular injections of diclofenac sodium and ketoprofen are rarely used; they are given deep into the gluteal muscle to minimise pain and tissue damage. Ketorolac trometamol is less irritant on intramuscular injection but pain has been reported; it can also be given by intravenous injection.

Suppositories of diclofenac sodium and ketoprofen may be effective alternatives to the parenteral use of these drugs.

Opioid analgesics

Opioid analgesics are now rarely used as premedicants; they are more likely to be administered at induction. Pre-operative use of opioid analgesics is generally limited to those patients who require control of existing pain. See general notes on opioid analgesics and their use in postoperative pain.

See the management of opioid-induced respiratory depression in Pre-medication and peri-operative drugs.

Intra-operative analgesia

Opioid analgesics given in small doses before or with induction reduce the dose requirement of some drugs used during anaesthesia.

Alfentanil, fentanyl, and remifentanil are particularly useful because they act within 1–2 minutes and have short durations of action. The initial doses of alfentanil or fentanyl are followed either by successive intravenous injections or by an intravenous infusion; prolonged infusions increase the duration of effect. Repeated intra-operative doses of alfentanil or fentanyl should be given with care since the resulting respiratory depression can persist postoperatively and occasionally it may become apparent for the first time postoperatively when monitoring of the patient might be less intensive. Alfentanil, fentanyl, and remifentanil can cause muscle rigidity, particularly of the chest wall or jaw; this can be managed by the use of neuromuscular blocking drugs.

In contrast to other opioids which are metabolised in the liver, remifentanil undergoes rapid metabolism by nonspecific blood and tissue esterases; its short duration of action allows prolonged administration at high dosage, without accumulation, and with little risk of residual postoperative respiratory depression. Remifentanil should not be given by intravenous injection intraoperatively, but it is well suited to continuous infusion; a supplementary analgesic is given before stopping the infusion of remifentanil.

Anti-d (Rh<sub>0</sub>) immunoglobulin is effective in raising the platelet count in about 80% of unsplenectomised rhesus-positive individuals; its effects may last longer than normal immunoglobulin for intravenous use, but further doses are usually required.

Other therapy that has been tried in refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura includes azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, ciclosporin, and danazol. Rituximab may also be effective and in some cases induces prolonged remission. For patients with chronic severe thrombocytopenia refractory to other therapy, tranexamic acid may be given to reduce the severity of haemorrhage.

Eltrombopag and romiplostim are thrombopoietin receptor agonists licensed for the treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in splenectomised patients refractory to other treatments, such as corticosteroids or immunoglobulins, or as a second-line treatment in non-splenectomised patients when surgery is contra-indicated (see also NICE guidance).

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (Pneumocystis carinii) occurs in immunosuppressed patients; it is a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS. Pneumocystis pneumonia should generally be treated by those experienced in its management. Blood gas measurement is used to assess disease severity.

Treatment

Mild to moderate disease

Co-trimoxazole in high dosage is the drug of choice for the treatment of mild to moderate pneumocystis pneumonia.

Atovaquone is licensed for the treatment of mild to moderate pneumocystis infection in patients who cannot tolerate co-trimoxazole. A combination of dapsone with trimethoprim is given by mouth for the treatment of mild to moderate disease [unlicensed indication].

A combination of clindamycin and primaquine by mouth is used in the treatment of mild to moderate disease [unlicensed indication]; this combination is associated with considerable toxicity.

Severe disease

Co-trimoxazole in high dosage, given by mouth or by intravenous infusion, is the drug of choice for the treatment of severe pneumocystis pneumonia. Pentamidine isetionate given by intravenous infusion is an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate co-trimoxazole, or who have not responded to it. Pentamidine isetionate is a potentially toxic drug that can cause severe hypotension during or immediately after infusion.

Corticosteroid treatment can be lifesaving in those with severe pneumocystis pneumonia.

Adjunctive therapy

In moderate to severe infections associated with HIV infection, prednisolone is given by mouth for 5 days (alternatively, hydrocortisone may be given parenterally); the dose is then reduced to complete 21 days of treatment. Corticosteroid treatment should ideally be started at the same time as the anti-pneumocystis therapy and certainly no later than 24–72 hours afterwards. The corticosteroid should be withdrawn before anti-pneumocystis treatment is complete.

Prophylaxis

Prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia should be given to all patients with a history of the infection. Prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia should also be considered for severely immunocompromised patients. Prophylaxis should continue until immunity recovers sufficiently. It should not be discontinued if the patient has oral candidiasis, continues to lose weight, or is receiving cytotoxic therapy or long-term immunosuppressant therapy. 

Co-trimoxazole by mouth is the drug of choice for prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia. It is given daily or on alternate days (3 times a week); the dose may be reduced to improve tolerance.

Inhaled pentamidine isetionate is better tolerated than parenteral pentamidine isetionate. Intermittent inhalation of pentamidine isetionate is used for prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia in patients unable to tolerate co-trimoxazole. It is effective but patients may be prone to extrapulmonary infection. Alternatively, dapsone can be used. Atovaquone has also been used for prophylaxis [unlicensed indication].

Diabetes insipidus

Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is used in the treatment of pituitary (‘cranial’) diabetes insipidus as is its analogue desmopressin. Dosage is tailored to produce a slight diuresis every 24 hours to avoid water intoxication. Treatment may be required for a limited period only in diabetes insipidus following trauma or pituitary surgery.

Desmopressin is more potent and has a longer duration of action than vasopressin; unlike vasopressin it has no vasoconstrictor effect. It is given by mouth or intranasally for maintenance therapy, and by injection in the postoperative period or in unconscious patients. Desmopressin is also used in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Following a dose intramuscularly or intranasally, restoration of the ability to concentrate urine after water deprivation confirms a diagnosis of cranial diabetes insipidus. Failure to respond occurs in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

In nephrogenic and partial pituitary diabetes insipidus benefit may be gained from the paradoxical antidiuretic effect of thiazides.

Carbamazepine is sometimes useful in partial pituitary diabetes insipidus [unlicensed]; it may act by sensitising the renal tubules to the action of remaining endogenous vasopressin.

Other uses

Desmopressin is also used to boost factor VIII concentration in mild to moderate haemophilia and in von Willebrand’s disease; it is also used to test fibrinolytic response. Desmopressin may also have a role in nocturnal enuresis.

Vasopressin infusion is used to control variceal bleeding in portal hypertension, prior to more definitive treatment and with variable results. Terlipressin acetate, a derivative of vasopressin with reportedly less pressor and antidiuretic activity, is used similarly.

Oxytocin, another posterior pituitary hormone, is indicated in obstetrics.

Antidiuretic hormone antagonists

Demeclocycline hydrochloride can be used in the treatment of hyponatraemia resulting from inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, if fluid restriction alone does not restore sodium concentration or is not tolerable. Demeclocycline hydrochloride is thought to act by directly blocking the renal tubular effect of antidiuretic hormone.

Tolvaptan is a vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist licensed for the treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; treatment duration with tolvaptan is determined by the underlying disease and its treatment.

Rapid correction of hyponatraemia during tolvaptan therapy can cause osmotic demyelination, leading to serious neurological events; close monitoring of serum sodium concentration and fluid balance is essential.

    <p>Regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents (Mendelson’s syndrome) can be an important complication of general anaesthesia, particularly in obstetrics and during emergency surgery, and requires prophylaxis against acid aspiration.

    <p>A <b>H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist</b> can be used before surgery to increase the pH and reduce the volume of gastric fluid. It does not affect the pH of fluid already in the stomach and this limits its value in emergency procedures; an oral H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist can be given 1–2 hours before the procedure. Antacids are frequently used to neutralise the acidity of the fluid already in the stomach; ‘clear’ (non-particulate) antacids such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-citrate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5120\">sodium citrate</xref> are preferred.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Sedative drugs</p>
    <p>Fear and anxiety before a procedure (including the night before) can be minimised by using a sedative drug, usually a <b>benzodiazepine</b>. Premedication may also augment the action of anaesthetics and provide some degree of pre-operative amnesia. The choice of drug depends on the individual, the nature of the procedure, the anaesthetic to be used, and other prevailing circumstances such as outpatients, obstetrics, and availability of recovery facilities. The choice also varies between elective and emergency procedures.</p>

Regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents (Mendelson’s syndrome) can be an important complication of general anaesthesia, particularly in obstetrics and during emergency surgery, and requires prophylaxis against acid aspiration. Prophylaxis is also needed in those with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and in circumstances where gastric emptying may be delayed.

A H2-receptor antagonist can be used before surgery to increase the pH and reduce the volume of gastric fluid. It does not affect the pH of fluid already in the stomach and this limits its value in emergency procedures; an oral H2-receptor antagonist can be given 1–2 hours before the procedure. Antacids are frequently used to neutralise the acidity of the fluid already in the stomach; ‘clear’ (non-particulate) antacids such as sodium citrate are preferred.

Antimuscarinic drugs

Antimuscarinic drugs are used (less commonly nowadays) as premedicants to dry bronchial and salivary secretions which are increased by intubation, upper airway surgery, or some inhalational anaesthetics. They are also used before or with neostigmine to prevent bradycardia, excessive salivation, and other muscarinic actions of neostigmine. They also prevent bradycardia and hypotension associated with drugs such as propofol and suxamethonium chloride.

Atropine sulfate is now rarely used for premedication but still has an emergency role in the treatment of vagotonic side-effects. Atropine sulfate may have a role in acute arrhythmias after myocardial infarction.

Hyoscine hydrobromide reduces secretions and also provides a degree of amnesia, sedation, and anti-emesis. Unlike atropine sulfate it may produce bradycardia rather than tachycardia.

Glycopyrronium bromide reduces salivary secretions. When given intravenously it produces less tachycardia than atropine sulfate. It is widely used with neostigmine for reversal of non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Phenothiazines do not effectively reduce secretions when used alone.

Sedative drugs

Fear and anxiety before a procedure (including the night before) can be minimised by using a sedative drug, usually a benzodiazepine. Premedication may also augment the action of anaesthetics and provide some degree of pre-operative amnesia. The choice of drug depends on the individual, the nature of the procedure, the anaesthetic to be used, and other prevailing circumstances such as outpatients, obstetrics, and availability of recovery facilities. The choice also varies between elective and emergency procedures.

Premedicants can be given the night before major surgery; a further, smaller dose may be required before surgery. Alternatively, the first dose may be given on the day of the procedure.

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines possess useful properties for premedication including relief of anxiety, sedation, and amnesia; short-acting benzodiazepines taken by mouth are the most common premedicants. Benzodiazepines are also used in intensive care units for sedation, particularly in those receiving assisted ventilation. Flumazenil is used to antagonise the effects of benzodiazepines.

Diazepam is used to produce mild sedation with amnesia. It is a long-acting drug with active metabolites and a second period of drowsiness can occur several hours after its administration. Peri-operative use of diazepam in children is not recommended; its effect and timing of response are unreliable and paradoxical effects may occur.

Diazepam is relatively insoluble in water and preparations formulated in organic solvents are painful on intravenous injection and give rise to a high incidence of venous thrombosis (which may not be noticed for several days after the injection). Intramuscular injection of diazepam is painful and absorption is erratic. An emulsion formulated for intravenous injection is less irritant and reduces the risk of venous thrombosis; it is not suitable for intramuscular injection. 

Temazepam is given by mouth for premedication and has a shorter duration of action and a more rapid onset than oral diazepam; anxiolytic and sedative effects last about 90 minutes although there may be residual drowsiness.

Lorazepam produces more prolonged sedation than temazepam and it has marked amnesic effects.

Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine that is often used in preference to intravenous diazepam; recovery is faster than from diazepam, but may be significantly longer in the elderly, in patients with a low cardiac output, or after repeated dosing. Midazolam is associated with profound sedation when high doses are given intravenously or when it is used with certain other drugs.

Other drugs for sedation

Dexmedetomidine and clonidine hydrochloride are alpha2-adrenergic agonists with sedative properties. Dexmedetomidine is licensed for the sedation of patients receiving intensive care who need to remain responsive to verbal stimulation. Clonidine hydrochloride [unlicensed indication] can be used by mouth or by intravenous injection as a sedative agent when adequate sedation cannot be achieved with standard treatment.

Antagonists for central and respiratory depression

Respiratory depression is a major concern with opioid analgesics and it may be treated by artificial ventilation or be reversed by naloxone hydrochloride. Naloxone hydrochloride will immediately reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression but the dose may have to be repeated because of the short duration of action of naloxone hydrochloride; however, naloxone hydrochloride will also antagonise the analgesic effect.

Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist for the reversal of the central sedative effects of benzodiazepines after anaesthetic and similar procedures. Flumazenil has a shorter half-life and duration of action than diazepam or midazolam so patients may become resedated.

Doxapram hydrochloride is a central and respiratory stimulant but is of limited value in anaesthesia.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Management</p>
    <p>Psoriasis is characterised by epidermal thickening and scaling. It commonly affects extensor surfaces and the scalp.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, psoriasis is provoked or exacerbated by drugs such as lithium, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, beta-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and ACE inhibitors. Psoriasis may not be seen until the drug has been taken for weeks or months.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Emollients</b>, in addition to their effects on dryness, scaling and cracking, may have an anti-proliferative effect in psoriasis, and may be the only treatment necessary for mild psoriasis. They are particularly useful in <i>inflammatory psoriasis</i> and in <i>plaque psoriasis of palms and soles</i>, in which irritant factors can perpetuate the condition. Emollients are useful adjuncts to other more specific treatment.</p>
    <p>More specific topical treatment for <i>chronic stable plaque psoriasis</i> on extensor surfaces of trunk and limbs involves the use of <b>vitamin D analogues</b>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/coal-tar.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP105665\">coal tar</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dithranol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7745\">dithranol</xref>, and the retinoid <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tazarotene.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7720\">tazarotene</xref>. However, they can irritate the skin and they are not suitable for the more inflammatory forms of psoriasis; their use should be suspended during an inflammatory phase of psoriasis. The efficacy and the irritancy of each substance varies between patients. If a substance irritates significantly, it should be stopped or the concentration reduced; if it is tolerated, its effects should be assessed after 4 to 6 weeks and treatment continued if it is effective.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Scalp psoriasis</i> is usually scaly, and the scale may be thick and adherent; this will require softening with an emollient cream, ointment, or oil. A tar-based shampoo is first-line treatment for scalp psoriasis; a keratolytic, such as salicylic acid, should also be used if there is significant scaling, to allow other treatments to work.</p>
    <p>Some preparations prescribed for psoriasis affecting the scalp, combine salicylic acid with coal tar or sulfur. The product should be applied generously, and an adequate quantity should be prescribed. It should be left on for at least an hour, often more conveniently overnight, before washing off. The use of scalp preparations containing a potent corticosteroid or a vitamin D analogue, either alone or in combination, can also be helpful.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Facial, flexural and genital psoriasis</i> can be managed with short-term use of a mild or moderate potency topical corticosteroid (a mild potency topical corticosteroid is preferred for the initial treatment of facial psoriasis). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/calcitriol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6240\">Calcitriol</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tacalcitol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7717\">tacalcitol</xref> can be used for longer-term treatment, or if the response to mild or moderate potency topical corticosteroids is inadequate; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/calcipotriol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7709\">calcipotriol</xref> is more likely to cause irritation. Low strength tar preparations can also be used. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pimecrolimus.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7778\">Pimecrolimus</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tacrolimus.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5639\">tacrolimus</xref> by topical application [unlicensed indication] can be used short-term, under specialist supervision, in patients whose condition has not responded adequately to other treatments, or who are intolerant of them.</p>
    <p>Widespread <i>unstable psoriasis</i> of erythrodermic or generalised pustular type requires urgent specialist assessment. Initial topical treatment should be limited to using emollients frequently and generously; emollients should be prescribed in quantities of 1 kg or more. More localised acute or subacute <i>inflammatory psoriasis</i> with hot, spreading or itchy lesions, should be treated topically with emollients or with a corticosteroid of moderate potency.</p>
    <p>

Psoriasis is characterised by epidermal thickening and scaling. It commonly affects extensor surfaces and the scalp.

Occasionally, psoriasis is provoked or exacerbated by drugs such as lithium, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, beta-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and ACE inhibitors. Psoriasis may not be seen until the drug has been taken for weeks or months.

Emollients, in addition to their effects on dryness, scaling and cracking, may have an anti-proliferative effect in psoriasis, and may be the only treatment necessary for mild psoriasis. They are particularly useful in inflammatory psoriasis and in plaque psoriasis of palms and soles, in which irritant factors can perpetuate the condition. Emollients are useful adjuncts to other more specific treatment.

More specific topical treatment for chronic stable plaque psoriasis on extensor surfaces of trunk and limbs involves the use of vitamin D analogues, coal tar, dithranol, and the retinoid tazarotene. However, they can irritate the skin and they are not suitable for the more inflammatory forms of psoriasis; their use should be suspended during an inflammatory phase of psoriasis. The efficacy and the irritancy of each substance varies between patients. If a substance irritates significantly, it should be stopped or the concentration reduced; if it is tolerated, its effects should be assessed after 4 to 6 weeks and treatment continued if it is effective.

Scalp psoriasis is usually scaly, and the scale may be thick and adherent; this will require softening with an emollient cream, ointment, or oil. A tar-based shampoo is first-line treatment for scalp psoriasis; a keratolytic, such as salicylic acid, should also be used if there is significant scaling, to allow other treatments to work.

Some preparations prescribed for psoriasis affecting the scalp, combine salicylic acid with coal tar or sulfur. The product should be applied generously, and an adequate quantity should be prescribed. It should be left on for at least an hour, often more conveniently overnight, before washing off. The use of scalp preparations containing a potent corticosteroid or a vitamin D analogue, either alone or in combination, can also be helpful.

Facial, flexural and genital psoriasis can be managed with short-term use of a mild or moderate potency topical corticosteroid (a mild potency topical corticosteroid is preferred for the initial treatment of facial psoriasis). Calcitriol or tacalcitol can be used for longer-term treatment, or if the response to mild or moderate potency topical corticosteroids is inadequate; calcipotriol is more likely to cause irritation. Low strength tar preparations can also be used. Pimecrolimus or tacrolimus by topical application [unlicensed indication] can be used short-term, under specialist supervision, in patients whose condition has not responded adequately to other treatments, or who are intolerant of them.

Widespread unstable psoriasis of erythrodermic or generalised pustular type requires urgent specialist assessment. Initial topical treatment should be limited to using emollients frequently and generously; emollients should be prescribed in quantities of 1 kg or more. More localised acute or subacute inflammatory psoriasis with hot, spreading or itchy lesions, should be treated topically with emollients or with a corticosteroid of moderate potency.

Calcipotrioland tacalcitol are analogues of vitamin D that affect cell division and differentiation. Calcitriol is an active form of vitamin D. Vitamin D and its analogues are used first-line for the long-term treatment of plaque psoriasis; they do not smell or stain and they may be more acceptable than tar or dithranol products. Of the vitamin D analogues, tacalcitol and calcitriol are less likely to irritate.

Coal tar has anti-inflammatory properties that are useful in chronic plaque psoriasis; it also has antiscaling properties. Crude coal tar (coal tar, BP) is the most effective form, typically in a concentration of 1 to 10% in a soft paraffin base, but few outpatients tolerate the smell and mess. Cleaner extracts of coal tar included in proprietary preparations, are more practicable for home use but they are less effective and improvement takes longer. Contact of coal tar products with normal skin is not normally harmful and they can be used for widespread small lesions; however, irritation, contact allergy, and sterile folliculitis can occur. The milder tar extracts can be used on the face and flexures. Tar baths and tar shampoos are also helpful.

Dithranol is effective for chronic plaque psoriasis. Its major disadvantages are irritation (for which individual susceptibility varies) and staining of skin and of clothing.Dithranol is not generally suitable for widespread small lesions nor should it be used in the flexures or on the face. Proprietary preparations are more suitable for home use; they are usually washed off after 5 to 60 minutes (‘short contact’). Specialist nurses may apply intensive treatment with dithranol paste which is covered by stockinette dressings and usually retained overnight. Dithranol should be discontinued if even a low concentration causes acute inflammation; continued use can result in the psoriasis becoming unstable.

Tazarotene, a retinoid, has a similar efficacy to vitamin D and its analogues, but is associated with a greater incidence of irritation. Although irritation is common, it is minimised by applying tazarotene sparingly to the plaques and avoiding normal skin; application to the face and in flexures should also be avoided. Tazarotene does not stain and is odourless.

A topical corticosteroid is not generally suitable for long-term use or as the sole treatment of extensive chronic plaque psoriasis; any early improvement is not usually maintained and there is a risk of the condition deteriorating or of precipitating an unstable form of psoriasis (e.g. erythrodermic psoriasis or generalised pustular psoriasis) on withdrawal. Topical use of potent corticosteroids on widespread psoriasis can also lead to systemic as well as local side-effects. However, topical corticosteroids used short-term may be appropriate to treat psoriasis in specific sites such as the face or flexures (with a mild or moderate corticosteroid), and psoriasis of the scalp, palms, and soles (with a potent corticosteroid). Very potent corticosteroids should only be used under specialist supervision.

Combining the use of a corticosteroid with another specific topical treatment may be beneficial in chronic plaque psoriasis; the drugs may be used separately at different times of the day or used together in a single formulation. Eczema co-existing with psoriasis may be treated with a corticosteroid, or coal tar, or both.

Phototherapy

Phototherapy is available in specialist centres under the supervision of a dermatologist. Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is usually effective for chronic stable psoriasis and for guttate psoriasis. It may be considered for patients with moderately severe psoriasis in whom topical treatment has failed, but it may irritate inflammatory psoriasis.

Photochemotherapy combining long-wave ultraviolet A radiation with a psoralen (PUVA) is available in specialist centres under the supervision of a dermatologist. The psoralen, which enhances the effect of irradiation, is administered either by mouth or topically. PUVA is effective in most forms of psoriasis, including localised palmoplantar pustular psoriasis. Early adverse effects include phototoxicity and pruritus. Higher cumulative doses exaggerate skin ageing, increase the risk of dysplastic and neoplastic skin lesions, especially squamous cancer, and pose a theoretical risk of cataracts.

Phototherapy combined with coal tar, dithranol, tazarotene, topical vitamin D or vitamin D analogues, or oral acitretin, allows reduction of the cumulative dose of phototherapy required to treat psoriasis.

Systemic treatment

Systemic treatment is required for severe, resistant, unstable or complicated forms of psoriasis, and it should be initiated only under specialist supervision. Systemic drugs for psoriasis include acitretin and drugs that affect the immune response (such as ciclosporin and methotrexate).

Systemic corticosteroids should be used only rarely in psoriasis because rebound deterioration may occur on reducing the dose.

Acitretin, a metabolite of etretinate, is a retinoid (vitamin A derivative); it is prescribed by specialists. The main indication for acitretin is psoriasis, but it is also used in disorders of keratinisation such as severe Darier’s disease (keratosis follicularis), and some forms of ichthyosis. Although a minority of cases of psoriasis respond well to acitretin alone, it is only moderately effective in many cases and it is combined with other treatments. A therapeutic effect occurs after 2 to 4 weeks and the maximum benefit after 4 months. Consideration should be given to stopping acitretin if the response is inadequate after 4 months at the optimum dose. The manufacturers of acitretin do not recommend continuous treatment for longer than 6 months. However, some patients may benefit from longer treatment, provided that the lowest effective dose is used, patients are monitored carefully for adverse effects, and the need for treatment is reviewed regularly.

Apart from teratogenicity, which remains a risk for 3 years after stopping, acitretin is the least toxic systemic treatment for psoriasis; in women with a potential for child-bearing, the possibility of pregnancy must be excluded before treatment and effective contraception must be used during treatment and for at least 3 years afterwards (oral progestogen-only contraceptives not considered effective).

Topical treatment

The vitamin D and analogues, calcipotriol, calcitriol, and tacalcitol are used for the management of plaque psoriasis. They should be avoided by those with calcium metabolism disorders, and used with caution in generalised pustular or erythrodermic exfoliative psoriasis (enhanced risk of hypercalcaemia).

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Advice of Royal College of Psychiatrists on doses of antipsychotic drugs above BNF upper limit</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated, doses in the BNF are licensed doses—any higher dose is therefore <b>unlicensed</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Consider alternative approaches including adjuvant therapy and newer or second-generation antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine.</li>
      <li>Bear in mind risk factors, including obesity; particular caution is indicated in older patients, especially those over 70.</li>
      <li>Consider potential for drug interactions—see interactions: Appendix 1 (antipsychotics).</li>
      <li>Carry out ECG to exclude untoward abnormalities such as prolonged QT interval; repeat ECG periodically and reduce dose if prolonged QT interval or other adverse cardiac abnormality develops.</li>
      <li>Increase dose slowly and not more often than once weekly.</li>
      <li>Carry out regular pulse, blood pressure, and temperature checks; ensure that patient maintains adequate fluid intake.</li>
      <li>Consider high-dose therapy to be for limited period and review regularly; abandon if no improvement after 3 months (return to standard dosage).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Important</b>: When prescribing an antipsychotic for administration on an emergency basis, the intramuscular dose should be <b>lower</b> than the corresponding oral dose (owing to absence of first-pass effect), particularly if the patient is very active (increased blood flow to muscle considerably increases the rate of absorption). The prescription should specify the dose for <b>each route</b> and should <b>not</b> imply that the same dose can be given by mouth or by intramuscular injection. The dose of antipsychotic for emergency use should be reviewed at least <b>daily</b>.</p>

    <p>In the short term they are used to calm disturbed patients whatever the underlying psychopathology, which may be schizophrenia, brain damage, mania, toxic delirium, or agitated depression. Antipsychotic drugs are used to alleviate severe anxiety but this too should be a short-term measure.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Schizophrenia</p>
      <p>The aim of treatment is to alleviate the suffering of the patient (and carer) and to improve social and cognitive functioning. Many patients require life-long treatment with antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic drugs relieve positive psychotic symptoms such as thought disorder, hallucinations, and delusions, and prevent relapse; they are usually less effective on negative symptoms such as apathy and social withdrawal. In many patients, negative symptoms persist between episodes of treated positive symptoms, but earlier treatment of psychotic illness may protect against the development of negative symptoms over time. Patients with acute schizophrenia generally respond better than those with chronic symptoms.</p>
      <p>Long-term treatment of a patient with a definitive diagnosis of schizophrenia is usually required after the first episode of illness in order to prevent relapses. Doses that are effective in acute episodes should generally be continued as prophylaxis.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">First-generation antipsychotic drugs</p>
      <p>The first-generation antipsychotic drugs act predominantly by blocking dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the brain. First-generation antipsychotic drugs are not selective for any of the four dopamine pathways in the brain and so can cause a range of side-effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms and elevated prolactin. The <b>phenothiazine</b> derivatives can be divided into 3 main groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Group 1</i>: <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlorpromazine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2213\">chlorpromazine hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/levomepromazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2234\">levomepromazine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/promazine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2251\">promazine hydrochloride</xref>, generally characterised by pronounced sedative effects and moderate antimuscarinic and extrapyramidal side-effects.</li>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Second-generation antipsychotic drugs</p>
      <p>The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (sometimes referred to as atypical antipsychotic drugs) act on a range of receptors in comparison to first-generation antipsychotic drugs and have more distinct clinical profiles, particularly with regard to side-effects.</p>

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Prescribing for the elderly</p>
      <p>The balance of risks and benefit should be considered before prescribing antipsychotic drugs for elderly patients. In elderly patients with dementia, antipsychotic drugs are associated with a small increased risk of mortality and an increased risk of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Furthermore, elderly patients are particularly susceptible to postural hypotension and to hyper- and hypothermia in hot or cold weather.</p>
      <p>It is recommended that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Antipsychotic drugs should not be used in elderly patients to treat mild to moderate psychotic symptoms.</li>
        <li>Initial doses of antipsychotic drugs in elderly patients should be reduced (to half the adult dose or less), taking into account factors such as the patient's weight, co-morbidity, and concomitant medication.</li>
        <li>Treatment should be reviewed regularly.</li>
      </ol>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Side effects of antipsychotic drugs</p>
      <p>Side-effects caused by antipsychotic drugs are common and contribute significantly to non-adherence to therapy.</p>
      <p>Extrapyramidal symptoms occur most frequently with the piperazine phenothiazines (fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine), the butyrophenones (benperidol and haloperidol), and the first-generation depot preparations. They are easy to recognise but cannot be predicted accurately because they depend on the dose, the type of drug, and on individual susceptibility.</p>
      <p>Extrapyramidal symptoms consist of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>parkinsonian symptoms </i>(including tremor), which may occur more commonly in adults or the elderly and may appear gradually;</li>
        <li>
          <i>dystonia</i> (abnormal face and body movements) and <i>dyskinesia</i>, which occur more commonly in children or young adults and appear after only a few doses;</li>
        <li>
          <i>akathisia</i> (restlessness), which characteristically occurs after large initial doses and may resemble an exacerbation of the condition being treated;</li>
        <li>
          <i>tardive dyskinesia</i> (rhythmic, involuntary movements of tongue, face, and jaw), which usually develops on long-term therapy or with high dosage, but it may develop on short-term treatment with low doses—short-lived tardive dyskinesia may occur after withdrawal of the drug.</li>
      </ul>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p>
          <i>Parkinsonian symptoms</i> remit if the drug is withdrawn and may be suppressed by the administration of antimuscarinic drugs. However, routine administration of such drugs is not justified because not all patients are affected and they may unmask or worsen tardive dyskinesia.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Tardive dyskinesia</i> is the most serious manifestation of extrapyramidal symptoms; it is of particular concern because it may be irreversible on withdrawing therapy and treatment is usually ineffective. In children, tardive dyskinesia is more likely to occur when the antipsychotic drug is withdrawn. However, some manufacturers suggest that drug withdrawal at the earliest signs of tardive dyskinesia (fine vermicular movements of the tongue) may halt its full development. Tardive dyskinesia occurs fairly frequently, especially in the elderly, and treatment must be carefully and regularly reviewed.</p>

      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Hyperprolactinaemia</p>
        <p>Most antipsychotic drugs, both first- and second-generation, increase prolactin concentration to some extent because dopamine inhibits prolactin release. Aripiprazole reduces prolactin because it is a dopamine-receptor partial agonist. Risperidone, amisulpride, and first-generation antipsychotic drugs are most likely to cause symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia. The clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia include sexual dysfunction, reduced bone mineral density, menstrual disturbances, breast enlargement, and galactorrhoea.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Sexual dysfunction</p>
        <p>Sexual dysfunction is one of the main causes of non-adherence to antipsychotic medication; physical illness, psychiatric illness, and substance misuse are contributing factors. Antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction is caused by more than one mechanism. Reduced dopamine transmission and hyperprolactinaemia decrease libido; antimuscarinic effects can cause disorders of arousal; and alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists are associated with erection and ejaculation problems in men. Risperidone and haloperidol commonly cause sexual dysfunction. If sexual dysfunction is thought to be antipsychotic-induced, dose reduction or switching medication should be considered.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Cardiovascular side-effects</p>
        <p>Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with cardiovascular side-effects such as tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension. QT-interval prolongation is a particular concern with pimozide and haloperidol. There is also a higher probability of QT-interval prolongation in patients using any intravenous antipsychotic drug, or any antipsychotic drug or combination of antipsychotic drugs with doses exceeding the recommended maximum. Cases of sudden death have occurred.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Hyperglycaemia</p>
        <p>Hyperglycaemia and sometimes diabetes can occur with antipsychotic drugs, particularly clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. All antipsychotic drugs may cause weight gain, but the risk and extent varies. Clozapine and olanzapine commonly cause weight gain.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Hypotension and interference with temperature regulation</p>
        <p>Hypotension and interference with temperature regulation are dose-related side-effects that are liable to cause dangerous falls and hypothermia or hyperthermia in the elderly. Clozapine, chlorpromazine, lurasidone, and quetiapine can cause postural hypotension (especially during initial dose titration) which may be associated with syncope or reflex tachycardia in some patients.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</p>
        <p>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hyperthermia, fluctuating level of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction with pallor, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, sweating, and urinary incontinence) is a rare but potentially fatal side-effect of all antipsychotic drugs. Discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug is essential because there is no proven effective treatment, but bromocriptine and dantrolene have been used. The syndrome, which usually lasts for 5–7 days after drug discontinuation, may be unduly prolonged if depot preparations have been used.</p>

      <p>There is little meaningful difference in efficacy between each of the antipsychotic drugs (other than <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clozapine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2273\">clozapine</xref>), and response and tolerability to each antipsychotic drug varies. There is no first-line antipsychotic drug which is suitable for all patients. Choice of antipsychotic medication is influenced by the patient’s medication history, the degree of sedation required (although tolerance to this usually develops), and consideration of individual patient factors such as risk of extrapyramidal side-effects, weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance, QT-interval prolongation, or the presence of negative symptoms.</p>
      <sectiondiv>

        <p outputclass=\"title\">Extrapyramidal side-effects</p>
        <p>Second-generation antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed if extrapyramidal side-effects are a particular concern.

Unless otherwise stated, doses in the BNF are licensed doses—any higher dose is therefore unlicensed

Consider alternative approaches including adjuvant therapy and newer or second-generation antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine.Bear in mind risk factors, including obesity; particular caution is indicated in older patients, especially those over 70.Consider potential for drug interactions—see interactions: Appendix 1 (antipsychotics).Carry out ECG to exclude untoward abnormalities such as prolonged QT interval; repeat ECG periodically and reduce dose if prolonged QT interval or other adverse cardiac abnormality develops.Increase dose slowly and not more often than once weekly.Carry out regular pulse, blood pressure, and temperature checks; ensure that patient maintains adequate fluid intake.Consider high-dose therapy to be for limited period and review regularly; abandon if no improvement after 3 months (return to standard dosage).Important: When prescribing an antipsychotic for administration on an emergency basis, the intramuscular dose should be lower than the corresponding oral dose (owing to absence of first-pass effect), particularly if the patient is very active (increased blood flow to muscle considerably increases the rate of absorption). The prescription should specify the dose for each route and should not imply that the same dose can be given by mouth or by intramuscular injection. The dose of antipsychotic for emergency use should be reviewed at least daily.

Antipsychotic drugs

Antipsychotic drugs are also known as ‘neuroleptics’ and (misleadingly) as ‘major tranquillisers’.

In the short term they are used to calm disturbed patients whatever the underlying psychopathology, which may be schizophrenia, brain damage, mania, toxic delirium, or agitated depression. Antipsychotic drugs are used to alleviate severe anxiety but this too should be a short-term measure.

Schizophrenia

The aim of treatment is to alleviate the suffering of the patient (and carer) and to improve social and cognitive functioning. Many patients require life-long treatment with antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic drugs relieve positive psychotic symptoms such as thought disorder, hallucinations, and delusions, and prevent relapse; they are usually less effective on negative symptoms such as apathy and social withdrawal. In many patients, negative symptoms persist between episodes of treated positive symptoms, but earlier treatment of psychotic illness may protect against the development of negative symptoms over time. Patients with acute schizophrenia generally respond better than those with chronic symptoms.

Long-term treatment of a patient with a definitive diagnosis of schizophrenia is usually required after the first episode of illness in order to prevent relapses. Doses that are effective in acute episodes should generally be continued as prophylaxis.

First-generation antipsychotic drugs

The first-generation antipsychotic drugs act predominantly by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. First-generation antipsychotic drugs are not selective for any of the four dopamine pathways in the brain and so can cause a range of side-effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms and elevated prolactin. The phenothiazine derivatives can be divided into 3 main groups:

Group 1: chlorpromazine hydrochloride, levomepromazine, and promazine hydrochloride, generally characterised by pronounced sedative effects and moderate antimuscarinic and extrapyramidal side-effects.Group 2: pericyazine, generally characterised by moderate sedative effects, but fewer extrapyramidal side-effects than groups 1 or 3.Group 3: fluphenazine decanoate, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine, generally characterised by fewer sedative and antimuscarinic effects, but more pronounced extrapyramidal side-effects than groups 1 and 2.Butyrophenones (benperidol and haloperidol) resemble the group 3 phenothiazines in their clinical properties. Thioxanthenes (flupentixol and zuclopenthixol ) have moderate sedative, antimuscarinic effects, and extrapyramidal effects. Diphenylbutylpiperidines (pimozide) and the substituted benzamides (sulpiride) have reduced sedative, antimuscarinic, and extrapyramidal effects.

Second-generation antipsychotic drugs

The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (sometimes referred to as atypical antipsychotic drugs) act on a range of receptors in comparison to first-generation antipsychotic drugs and have more distinct clinical profiles, particularly with regard to side-effects.

Prescribing for the elderly

The balance of risks and benefit should be considered before prescribing antipsychotic drugs for elderly patients. In elderly patients with dementia, antipsychotic drugs are associated with a small increased risk of mortality and an increased risk of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Furthermore, elderly patients are particularly susceptible to postural hypotension and to hyper- and hypothermia in hot or cold weather.

It is recommended that:

 Antipsychotic drugs should not be used in elderly patients to treat mild to moderate psychotic symptoms.Initial doses of antipsychotic drugs in elderly patients should be reduced (to half the adult dose or less), taking into account factors such as the patient's weight, co-morbidity, and concomitant medication.Treatment should be reviewed regularly.Side effects of antipsychotic drugs

Side-effects caused by antipsychotic drugs are common and contribute significantly to non-adherence to therapy.

Extrapyramidal symptoms occur most frequently with the piperazine phenothiazines (fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine), the butyrophenones (benperidol and haloperidol), and the first-generation depot preparations. They are easy to recognise but cannot be predicted accurately because they depend on the dose, the type of drug, and on individual susceptibility.

Extrapyramidal symptoms consist of:

parkinsonian symptoms (including tremor), which may occur more commonly in adults or the elderly and may appear gradually;dystonia (abnormal face and body movements) and dyskinesia, which occur more commonly in children or young adults and appear after only a few doses;akathisia (restlessness), which characteristically occurs after large initial doses and may resemble an exacerbation of the condition being treated;tardive dyskinesia (rhythmic, involuntary movements of tongue, face, and jaw), which usually develops on long-term therapy or with high dosage, but it may develop on short-term treatment with low doses—short-lived tardive dyskinesia may occur after withdrawal of the drug.Parkinsonian symptoms remit if the drug is withdrawn and may be suppressed by the administration of antimuscarinic drugs. However, routine administration of such drugs is not justified because not all patients are affected and they may unmask or worsen tardive dyskinesia.

Tardive dyskinesia is the most serious manifestation of extrapyramidal symptoms; it is of particular concern because it may be irreversible on withdrawing therapy and treatment is usually ineffective. In children, tardive dyskinesia is more likely to occur when the antipsychotic drug is withdrawn. However, some manufacturers suggest that drug withdrawal at the earliest signs of tardive dyskinesia (fine vermicular movements of the tongue) may halt its full development. Tardive dyskinesia occurs fairly frequently, especially in the elderly, and treatment must be carefully and regularly reviewed.

Hyperprolactinaemia

Most antipsychotic drugs, both first- and second-generation, increase prolactin concentration to some extent because dopamine inhibits prolactin release. Aripiprazole reduces prolactin because it is a dopamine-receptor partial agonist. Risperidone, amisulpride, and first-generation antipsychotic drugs are most likely to cause symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia. The clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia include sexual dysfunction, reduced bone mineral density, menstrual disturbances, breast enlargement, and galactorrhoea.

Sexual dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction is one of the main causes of non-adherence to antipsychotic medication; physical illness, psychiatric illness, and substance misuse are contributing factors. Antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction is caused by more than one mechanism. Reduced dopamine transmission and hyperprolactinaemia decrease libido; antimuscarinic effects can cause disorders of arousal; and alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists are associated with erection and ejaculation problems in men. Risperidone and haloperidol commonly cause sexual dysfunction. If sexual dysfunction is thought to be antipsychotic-induced, dose reduction or switching medication should be considered.

Cardiovascular side-effects

Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with cardiovascular side-effects such as tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension. QT-interval prolongation is a particular concern with pimozide and haloperidol. There is also a higher probability of QT-interval prolongation in patients using any intravenous antipsychotic drug, or any antipsychotic drug or combination of antipsychotic drugs with doses exceeding the recommended maximum. Cases of sudden death have occurred.

Hyperglycaemia

Hyperglycaemia and sometimes diabetes can occur with antipsychotic drugs, particularly clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. All antipsychotic drugs may cause weight gain, but the risk and extent varies. Clozapine and olanzapine commonly cause weight gain.

Hypotension and interference with temperature regulation

Hypotension and interference with temperature regulation are dose-related side-effects that are liable to cause dangerous falls and hypothermia or hyperthermia in the elderly. Clozapine, chlorpromazine, lurasidone, and quetiapine can cause postural hypotension (especially during initial dose titration) which may be associated with syncope or reflex tachycardia in some patients.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hyperthermia, fluctuating level of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction with pallor, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, sweating, and urinary incontinence) is a rare but potentially fatal side-effect of all antipsychotic drugs. Discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug is essential because there is no proven effective treatment, but bromocriptine and dantrolene have been used. The syndrome, which usually lasts for 5–7 days after drug discontinuation, may be unduly prolonged if depot preparations have been used.

Blood dyscrasias

Perform blood counts if unexplained infection or fever develops.

Choice

There is little meaningful difference in efficacy between each of the antipsychotic drugs (other than clozapine), and response and tolerability to each antipsychotic drug varies. There is no first-line antipsychotic drug which is suitable for all patients. Choice of antipsychotic medication is influenced by the patient’s medication history, the degree of sedation required (although tolerance to this usually develops), and consideration of individual patient factors such as risk of extrapyramidal side-effects, weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance, QT-interval prolongation, or the presence of negative symptoms.

Negative symptoms

Second generation antipsychotic drugs may be better at treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

Extrapyramidal side-effects

Second-generation antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed if extrapyramidal side-effects are a particular concern. Of these, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine are least likely to cause extrapyramidal side-effects. Although amisulpride is a dopamine-receptor antagonist, extrapyramidal side-effects are less common than with the first-generation antipsychotic drugs because amisulpride selectively blocks mesolimbic dopamine receptors, and extrapyramidal symptoms are caused by blockade of the striatal dopamine pathway.

QT interval

Aripiprazole has negligible effect on the QT interval. Other antipsychotic drugs with a reduced tendency to prolong QT interval include amisulpride, clozapine, flupentixol, fluphenazine decanoate, olanzapine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, risperidone, and sulpiride.

Diabetes

Schizophrenia is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes; the risk of diabetes is increased in patients with schizophrenia who take antipsychotic drugs. First-generation antipsychotic drugs are less likely to cause diabetes than second-generation antipsychotic drugs, and of the first-generation antipsychotic drugs, fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol are lowest risk. Amisulpride and aripiprazole have the lowest risk of diabetes of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Amisulpride, aripiprazole, haloperidol, sulpiride, and trifluoperazine are least likely to cause weight gain.

Sexual dysfunction and prolactin

The antipsychotic drugs with the lowest risk of sexual dysfunction are aripiprazole and quetiapine. Olanzapine may be considered if sexual dysfunction is judged to be secondary to hyperprolactinaemia. Hyperprolactinaemia is usually not clinically significant with aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine treatment. When changing from other antipsychotic drugs, a reduction in prolactin concentration may increase fertility.

Patients should receive an antipsychotic drug for 4–6 weeks before it is deemed ineffective. Prescribing more than one antipsychotic drug at a time should be avoided except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. clozapine augmentation or when changing medication during titration) because of the increased risk of adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, QT-interval prolongation, and sudden cardiac death.

Clozapine is licensed for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, other antipsychotic drugs. Clozapine should be introduced if schizophrenia is not controlled despite the sequential use of two or more antipsychotic drugs (one of which should be a second-generation antipsychotic drug), each for at least 6–8 weeks. If symptoms do not respond adequately to an optimised dose of clozapine, plasma-clozapine concentration should be checked before adding a second antipsychotic drug to augment clozapine; allow 8–10 weeks’ treatment to assess response. Patients must be registered with a clozapine patient monitoring service.

Monitoring

Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, and liver function test monitoring is required at the start of therapy with antipsychotic drugs, and then annually thereafter.

Blood lipids and weight should be measured at baseline, at 3 months (weight should be measured at frequent intervals during the first 3 months), and then yearly.

Fasting blood glucose should be measured at baseline, at 4–6 months, and then yearly.

Before initiating antipsychotic drugs, an ECG may be required, particularly if physical examination identifies cardiovascular risk factors, if there is a personal history of cardiovascular disease, or if the patient is being admitted as an inpatient.

Blood pressure monitoring is advised before starting therapy and frequently during dose titration of antipsychotic drugs.

Other uses

Some antipsychotic drugs can be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, choreas, and motor tics. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride and haloperidol can be used for intractable hiccup. Benperidol is used in deviant antisocial sexual behaviour but its value is not established.

Psychomotor agitation should be investigated for an underlying cause; it can be managed with low doses of chlorpromazine hydrochloride or haloperidol used for short periods. Antipsychotic drugs can be used with caution for the short-term treatment of severe agitation and restlessness in the elderly.

Equivalent doses of oral antipsychotics

These equivalences are intended only as an approximate guide; individual dosage instructions should also be checked; patients should be carefully monitored after any change in medication. Equivalent daily dose of antipsychotic drug:

Chlorpromazine 100 mgClozapine 50 mgHaloperidol 2–3 mgPimozide 2 mg Risperidone 0.5–1 mgSulpiride 200 mgTrifluoperazine 5 mgImportant:These equivalences must not be extrapolated beyond the maximum dose for the drug. Higher doses require careful titration in specialist units and the equivalences shown here may not be appropriate.

Dosage

After an initial period of stabilisation, in most patients, the total daily oral dose can be given as a single dose. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has published advice on doses of antipsychotic drugs above BNF upper limit.

Antipsychotic depot injections

Long-acting depot injections are used for maintenance therapy especially when compliance with oral treatment is unreliable. However, depot injections of conventional antipsychotics may give rise to a higher incidence of extrapyramidal reactions than oral preparations; extrapyramidal reactions occur less frequently with second-generation antipsychotic depot preparations, such as risperidone and olanzapine embonate.

Choice

There is no clear-cut division in the use of the conventional antipsychotics, but zuclopenthixol may be suitable for the treatment of agitated or aggressive patients whereas flupentixol decanoate can cause over-excitement in such patients. Zuclopenthixol decanoate may be more effective in preventing relapses than other conventional antipsychotic depot preparations. The incidence of extrapyramidal reactions is similar for the conventional antipsychotics.

Dosage

Individual responses to neuroleptic drugs are variable and to achieve optimum effect, dosage and dosage interval must be titrated according to the patient's response.

Nalidixic acid and norfloxacin are effective in uncomplicated urinary-tract infections .

Ciprofloxacin is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, neisseria, and pseudomonas. Ciprofloxacin has only moderate activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis; it should not be used for pneumococcal pneumonia. It is active against chlamydia and some mycobacteria. Most anaerobic organisms are not susceptible. Ciprofloxacin can be used for respiratory tract infections (but not for pneumococcal pneumonia), urinary-tract infections , infections of the gastro-intestinal system (including typhoid fever), bone and joint infections, gonorrhoea and septicaemia caused by sensitive organisms.

Ofloxacin is used for urinary-tract infections , lower respiratory-tract infections, gonorrhoea, and non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis.

Levofloxacin is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It has greater activity against pneumococci than ciprofloxacin. Levofloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia, but it should only be considered for these infections when first-line treatment cannot be used or is ineffective. Levofloxacin is also licensed for the treatment of urinary-tract infections.

Although ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin are licensed for skin and soft-tissue infections, many staphylococci are resistant to the quinolones and their use should be avoided in MRSA infections.

Moxifloxacin should be reserved for the treatment of sinusitis, community-acquired pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, mild to moderate pelvic inflammatory disease, or complicated skin and soft-tissue infections which have failed to respond to other antibacterials or for patients who cannot be treated with other antibacterials. It has been associated with QT interval prolongation and life-threatening hepatotoxicity. Moxifloxacin is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It has greater activity against Gram-positive organisms, including pneumococci, than ciprofloxacin. Moxifloxacin is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Cleansing with attention to any minor faecal soiling, adjustment of the diet to avoid hard stools, the use of bulk-forming materials such as bran and a high residue diet are helpful. In proctitis these measures may supplement treatment with corticosteroids or sulfasalazine.

When necessary, topical preparations containing local anaesthetics or corticosteroids are used, provided perianal thrush has been excluded. Perianal thrush is treated with a topical antifungal preparation.

Soothing haemorrhoidal preparations

Soothing preparations containing mild astringents such as bismuth subgallate, zinc oxide, and hamamelis may give symptomatic relief in haemorrhoids. Many proprietary preparations also contain lubricants, vasoconstrictors, or mild antiseptics.

Local anaesthetics are used to relieve pain associated with haemorrhoids and pruritus ani but good evidence is lacking.

Corticosteroids are often combined with local anaesthetics and soothing agents in preparations for haemorrhoids. They are suitable for occasional short-term use after exclusion of infections, such as herpes simplex; prolonged use can cause atrophy of the anal skin.

Oily phenol injection is used to inject haemorrhoids particularly when unprolapsed.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Inhalation</p>
    <p>This route delivers the drug directly to the airways; the dose required is smaller than when given by mouth and side-effects are reduced.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Inhaler devices</p>
      <p>These include <i>pressurised metered-dose inhalers</i>, <i>breath-actuated inhalers</i>, and <i>dry powder inhalers</i>. Many patients can be taught to use a pressurised metered-dose inhaler effectively but some patients, particularly the elderly and children, find them difficult to use. <i>Spacer devices</i> can help such patients because they remove the need to co-ordinate actuation with inhalation. Dry powder inhalers may be useful in adults and children over 5 years who are unwilling or unable to use a pressurised metered-dose inhaler. Alternatively, breath-actuated inhalers are suitable for adults and older children provided they can use the device effectively.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Pressurised metered-dose inhalers</i> are an effective and convenient method of drug administration in mild to moderate asthma.</p>
      <p>On changing from a pressurised metered-dose inhaler to a dry powder inhaler, patients may notice a lack of sensation in the mouth and throat previously associated with each actuation. Coughing may also occur.</p>
      <p>The patient should be instructed carefully on the use of the inhaler and it is important to check that the inhaler continues to be used correctly because inadequate inhalation technique may be mistaken for a lack of response to the drug.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Spacer devices</p>
      <p>Spacer devices remove the need for coordination between actuation of a pressurised metered-dose inhaler and inhalation. The spacer device reduces the velocity of the aerosol and subsequent impaction on the oropharynx and allows more time for evaporation of the propellant so that a larger proportion of the particles can be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. Spacer devices are particularly useful for patients with poor inhalation technique, for children, for patients requiring high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, for nocturnal asthma, and for patients prone to candidiasis with inhaled corticosteroids. The size of the spacer is important, the larger spacers with a one-way valve (<i>Volumatic</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) being most effective. It is important to prescribe a spacer device that is compatible with the metered-dose inhaler, see devices below. Spacer devices should not be regarded as interchangeable; patients should be advised not to switch between spacer devices.</p>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Use and care of spacer devices</p>
        <p>Patients should inhale from the spacer device as soon as possible after actuation because the drug aerosol is very short-lived; single-dose actuation is recommended. Tidal breathing is as effective as single breaths. The device should be cleaned once a month by washing in mild detergent and then allowed to dry in air without rinsing; the mouthpiece should be wiped clean of detergent before use. Some manufacturers recommend more frequent cleaning, but this should be avoided since any electrostatic charge may affect drug delivery. Spacer devices should be replaced every 6–12 months.</p>
      </sectiondiv>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Nebulisers</p>
      <p>
        <i>Solutions for nebulisation</i> are available for use in severe acute asthma. They are administered over 5–10 minutes from a nebuliser usually driven by oxygen in hospital.</p>
      <p>Patients with a severe attack of asthma should preferably have oxygen during nebulisation since beta<sub>2</sub> agonists can increase arterial hypoxaemia.</p>
      <p>A nebuliser converts a solution of a drug into an aerosol for inhalation. It is used to deliver higher doses of drug to the airways than is usual with standard inhalers. The main indications for use of a nebuliser are to deliver:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a beta<sub>2</sub> agonist or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ipratropium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1791\">ipratropium bromide</xref> to a patient with an <i>acute exacerbation</i> of asthma or of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;</li>
        <li>a beta<sub>2</sub> agonist, corticosteroid, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ipratropium-bromide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1791\">ipratropium bromide</xref> on a <i>regular basis</i> to a patient with severe asthma or reversible airways obstruction when the patient is unable to use other inhalational devices;</li>
        <li>an antibiotic (such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/colistimethate-sodium.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3560\">colistimethate sodium</xref>) or a mucolytic to a patient with cystic fibrosis;</li>
        <li>
          <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/budesonide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP512\">Budesonide</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/adrenalineepinephrine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1435\">adrenaline/epinephrine</xref> to a child with severe croup;</li>
        <li>
          <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pentamidine-isetionate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4003\">Pentamidine isetionate</xref> for the prophylaxis and treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The use of nebulisers in chronic persistent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be considered only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>after a review of the diagnosis;</li>
        <li>after review of therapy (see also Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and the patient’s ability to use hand-held devices;</li>
        <li>after increased doses of inhaled therapy from hand-held inhalers (with a spacer if necessary) have been tried for 2 weeks;</li>
        <li>if the patient remains breathless, despite correctly using optimal therapy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before prescribing a nebuliser, a home trial should preferably be undertaken to monitor response for up to 2 weeks on standard treatment and up to 2 weeks on nebulised treatment. If prescribed, patients must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have clear instructions from a doctor, specialist nurse, physiotherapist, or pharmacist on the use of the nebuliser (including maintenance and cleaning) and on peak-flow monitoring;</li>
        <li>be instructed not to treat acute attacks at home without also seeking help;</li>
        <li>have regular follow up by a doctor, specialist nurse or physiotherapist after about 1 month and annually thereafter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The proportion of a nebuliser solution that reaches the lungs depends on the type of nebuliser and although it can be as high as 30%, it is more frequently close to 10% and sometimes below 10%. The remaining solution is left in the nebuliser as residual volume or is deposited in the mouthpiece and tubing. The extent to which the nebulised solution is deposited in the airways or alveoli depends on the droplet size, pattern of breath inhalation, and condition of the lung. Droplets with a mass median diameter of 1–5 microns are deposited in the airways and are therefore appropriate for asthma, whereas a particle size of 1–2 microns is needed for alveolar deposition of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pentamidine-isetionate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4003\">pentamidine isetionate</xref> to combat pneumocystis infection. The type of nebuliser is therefore chosen according to the deposition required and according to the viscosity of the solution.</p>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Jet nebulisers</p>
        <p>Jet nebulisers are more widely used than ultrasonic nebulisers. Most jet nebulisers require an optimum gas flow rate of 6–8 litres/minute and in hospital can be driven by piped air or oxygen; in acute asthma the nebuliser should be driven by oxygen. Domiciliary oxygen cylinders do not provide an adequate flow rate therefore an electrical compressor is required for domiciliary use.</p>
        <p>For patients at risk of hypercapnia, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oxygen can be dangerous and the nebuliser should be driven by air. If oxygen is required, it should be given simultaneously by nasal cannula.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Tubing</p>
        <p>The Department of Health has reminded users of the need to use the correct grade of tubing when connecting a nebuliser to a medical gas supply or compressor.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Ultrasonic nebulisers</p>
        <p>Ultrasonic nebulisers produce an aerosol by ultrasonic vibration of the drug solution and therefore do not require a gas flow; they are not suitable for the nebulisation of some drugs, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/dornase-alfa.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2027\">dornase alfa</xref> and nebulised suspensions.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p outputclass=\"title\">Nebuliser diluent</p>
        <p>Nebulisation may be carried out using an undiluted nebuliser solution or it may require dilution beforehand. The usual diluent is sterile sodium chloride 0.9% (physiological saline).</p>
      </sectiondiv>
    </sectiondiv>
    <p>In England and Wales nebulisers and compressors are not available on the NHS (but they are free of VAT); some nebulisers (but not compressors) are available on form GP10A in Scotland (for details consult Scottish Drug Tariff).</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Oral</p>
    <p>The oral route is used when administration by inhalation is not possible. Systemic side-effects occur more frequently when a drug is given orally rather than by inhalation. Drugs given by mouth for the treatment of asthma include beta<sub>2</sub> agonists, corticosteroids, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/theophylline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1803\">theophylline</xref>, and leukotriene receptor antagonists.</p>

    <p>Drugs such as beta<sub>2</sub> agonists, corticosteroids, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/aminophylline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1811\">aminophylline</xref> can be given by injection in acute severe asthma when administration by nebulisation is inadequate or inappropriate.

The patient should be instructed carefully on the use of the inhaler and it is important to check that the inhaler continues to be used correctly because inadequate inhalation technique may be mistaken for a lack of response to the drug.

Spacer devices

Spacer devices remove the need for coordination between actuation of a pressurised metered-dose inhaler and inhalation. The spacer device reduces the velocity of the aerosol and subsequent impaction on the oropharynx and allows more time for evaporation of the propellant so that a larger proportion of the particles can be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. Spacer devices are particularly useful for patients with poor inhalation technique, for children, for patients requiring high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, for nocturnal asthma, and for patients prone to candidiasis with inhaled corticosteroids. The size of the spacer is important, the larger spacers with a one-way valve (Volumatic) being most effective. It is important to prescribe a spacer device that is compatible with the metered-dose inhaler, see devices below. Spacer devices should not be regarded as interchangeable; patients should be advised not to switch between spacer devices.

Use and care of spacer devices

Patients should inhale from the spacer device as soon as possible after actuation because the drug aerosol is very short-lived; single-dose actuation is recommended. Tidal breathing is as effective as single breaths. The device should be cleaned once a month by washing in mild detergent and then allowed to dry in air without rinsing; the mouthpiece should be wiped clean of detergent before use. Some manufacturers recommend more frequent cleaning, but this should be avoided since any electrostatic charge may affect drug delivery. Spacer devices should be replaced every 6–12 months.

Nebulisers

Solutions for nebulisation are available for use in severe acute asthma. They are administered over 5–10 minutes from a nebuliser usually driven by oxygen in hospital.

Patients with a severe attack of asthma should preferably have oxygen during nebulisation since beta2 agonists can increase arterial hypoxaemia.

A nebuliser converts a solution of a drug into an aerosol for inhalation. It is used to deliver higher doses of drug to the airways than is usual with standard inhalers. The main indications for use of a nebuliser are to deliver:

a beta2 agonist or ipratropium bromide to a patient with an acute exacerbation of asthma or of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;a beta2 agonist, corticosteroid, or ipratropium bromide on a regular basis to a patient with severe asthma or reversible airways obstruction when the patient is unable to use other inhalational devices;an antibiotic (such as colistimethate sodium) or a mucolytic to a patient with cystic fibrosis;Budesonide or adrenaline/epinephrine to a child with severe croup;Pentamidine isetionate for the prophylaxis and treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia.The use of nebulisers in chronic persistent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be considered only:

after a review of the diagnosis;after review of therapy (see also Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and the patient’s ability to use hand-held devices;after increased doses of inhaled therapy from hand-held inhalers (with a spacer if necessary) have been tried for 2 weeks;if the patient remains breathless, despite correctly using optimal therapy.Before prescribing a nebuliser, a home trial should preferably be undertaken to monitor response for up to 2 weeks on standard treatment and up to 2 weeks on nebulised treatment. If prescribed, patients must:

have clear instructions from a doctor, specialist nurse, physiotherapist, or pharmacist on the use of the nebuliser (including maintenance and cleaning) and on peak-flow monitoring;be instructed not to treat acute attacks at home without also seeking help;have regular follow up by a doctor, specialist nurse or physiotherapist after about 1 month and annually thereafter.The proportion of a nebuliser solution that reaches the lungs depends on the type of nebuliser and although it can be as high as 30%, it is more frequently close to 10% and sometimes below 10%. The remaining solution is left in the nebuliser as residual volume or is deposited in the mouthpiece and tubing. The extent to which the nebulised solution is deposited in the airways or alveoli depends on the droplet size, pattern of breath inhalation, and condition of the lung. Droplets with a mass median diameter of 1–5 microns are deposited in the airways and are therefore appropriate for asthma, whereas a particle size of 1–2 microns is needed for alveolar deposition of pentamidine isetionate to combat pneumocystis infection. The type of nebuliser is therefore chosen according to the deposition required and according to the viscosity of the solution.

Jet nebulisers

Jet nebulisers are more widely used than ultrasonic nebulisers. Most jet nebulisers require an optimum gas flow rate of 6–8 litres/minute and in hospital can be driven by piped air or oxygen; in acute asthma the nebuliser should be driven by oxygen. Domiciliary oxygen cylinders do not provide an adequate flow rate therefore an electrical compressor is required for domiciliary use.

For patients at risk of hypercapnia, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oxygen can be dangerous and the nebuliser should be driven by air. If oxygen is required, it should be given simultaneously by nasal cannula.

Tubing

The Department of Health has reminded users of the need to use the correct grade of tubing when connecting a nebuliser to a medical gas supply or compressor.

Ultrasonic nebulisers

Ultrasonic nebulisers produce an aerosol by ultrasonic vibration of the drug solution and therefore do not require a gas flow; they are not suitable for the nebulisation of some drugs, such as dornase alfa and nebulised suspensions.

Nebuliser diluent

Nebulisation may be carried out using an undiluted nebuliser solution or it may require dilution beforehand. The usual diluent is sterile sodium chloride 0.9% (physiological saline).

In England and Wales nebulisers and compressors are not available on the NHS (but they are free of VAT); some nebulisers (but not compressors) are available on form GP10A in Scotland (for details consult Scottish Drug Tariff).

Oral

The oral route is used when administration by inhalation is not possible. Systemic side-effects occur more frequently when a drug is given orally rather than by inhalation. Drugs given by mouth for the treatment of asthma include beta2 agonists, corticosteroids, theophylline, and leukotriene receptor antagonists.

Parenteral

Drugs such as beta2 agonists, corticosteroids, and aminophylline can be given by injection in acute severe asthma when administration by nebulisation is inadequate or inappropriate. If the patient is being treated in the community, urgent transfer to hospital should be arranged.

    <p>Certain drugs such as those affecting the immune response can suppress the disease process in <i>rheumatoid arthritis</i> and <i>psoriatic arthritis</i>; gold, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/penicillamine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6302\">penicillamine</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydroxychloroquine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6586\">hydroxychloroquine sulfate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chloroquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3939\">chloroquine</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sulfasalazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP504\">sulfasalazine</xref> can also suppress the disease process in <i>rheumatoid arthritis</i> while <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sulfasalazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP504\">sulfasalazine</xref> and possibly gold can suppress the disease process in <i>psoriatic arthritis</i>. Unlike NSAIDs, which are used only for symptom control, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can affect the progression of disease but may require 2–6 months of treatment for a full therapeutic response. Response to DMARDs may allow the NSAID dose to be reduced or withdrawn. All patients with suspected inflammatory joint disease should be referred to a specialist as soon as possible to confirm diagnosis and evaluate disease activity; early initiation of DMARDs is recommended to control the signs and symptoms, and to limit joint damage.</p>

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Choice</p>
      <p>The choice of a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug should take into account co-morbidity and patient preference. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methotrexate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP533\">Methotrexate</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sulfasalazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP504\">sulfasalazine</xref>, intramuscular gold, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/penicillamine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6302\">penicillamine</xref> are similar in efficacy. However, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methotrexate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP533\">methotrexate</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sulfasalazine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP504\">sulfasalazine</xref> may be better tolerated.</p>
      <p>A combination of <b>DMARDs</b> (including <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methotrexate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP533\">methotrexate</xref> and at least one other DMARD) and a short-term <b>corticosteroid</b>, should be given to patients with newly diagnosed active rheumatoid arthritis, ideally within 3 months of the onset of persistent symptoms. If the use of particular DMARDs is contra-indicated and combination therapy is not possible, monotherapy with a suitable DMARD should be given and the dose rapidly increased until clinically effective. In patients with established and stable rheumatoid arthritis, cautiously reduce drug doses to the lowest that are clinically effective. Response to drug treatment often produces a reduction in requirements of both corticosteroids and other drugs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gold</b> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/penicillamine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6302\">penicillamine</xref> are effective in <i>palindromic rheumatism</i>. <i>Systemic</i> and <i>discoid lupus erythematosus</i> are sometimes treated with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chloroquine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3939\">chloroquine</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hydroxychloroquine-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6586\">hydroxychloroquine sulfate</xref>.</p>
      <p>If a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug does not lead to an objective benefit within 6 months, it should be replaced by a different one.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Gold</p>
    <p>
      <b>Gold</b> can be given as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/sodium-aurothiomalate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6560\">sodium aurothiomalate</xref> for active progressive rheumatoid arthritis; it must be given by deep intramuscular injection and the area gently massaged. A test dose must be given followed by doses at weekly intervals until there is definite evidence of remission. In patients who do respond, the interval between injections is then gradually increased to 4 weeks and treatment is continued for up to 5 years after complete remission. If relapse occurs the dosage frequency may be immediately increased and only once control has been obtained again should the dosage frequency be decreased; if no response is seen within 2 months, alternative treatment should be sought. It is important to avoid complete relapse since second courses of gold are not usually effective.</p>

Certain drugs such as those affecting the immune response can suppress the disease process in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis; gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, chloroquine, and sulfasalazine can also suppress the disease process in rheumatoid arthritis while sulfasalazine and possibly gold can suppress the disease process in psoriatic arthritis. Unlike NSAIDs, which are used only for symptom control, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can affect the progression of disease but may require 2–6 months of treatment for a full therapeutic response. Response to DMARDs may allow the NSAID dose to be reduced or withdrawn. All patients with suspected inflammatory joint disease should be referred to a specialist as soon as possible to confirm diagnosis and evaluate disease activity; early initiation of DMARDs is recommended to control the signs and symptoms, and to limit joint damage.

Choice

The choice of a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug should take into account co-morbidity and patient preference. Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, intramuscular gold, and penicillamine are similar in efficacy. However, methotrexate or sulfasalazine may be better tolerated.

A combination of DMARDs (including methotrexate and at least one other DMARD) and a short-term corticosteroid, should be given to patients with newly diagnosed active rheumatoid arthritis, ideally within 3 months of the onset of persistent symptoms. If the use of particular DMARDs is contra-indicated and combination therapy is not possible, monotherapy with a suitable DMARD should be given and the dose rapidly increased until clinically effective. In patients with established and stable rheumatoid arthritis, cautiously reduce drug doses to the lowest that are clinically effective. Response to drug treatment often produces a reduction in requirements of both corticosteroids and other drugs.

Gold and penicillamine are effective in palindromic rheumatism. Systemic and discoid lupus erythematosus are sometimes treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine sulfate.

If a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug does not lead to an objective benefit within 6 months, it should be replaced by a different one.

Gold

Gold can be given as sodium aurothiomalate for active progressive rheumatoid arthritis; it must be given by deep intramuscular injection and the area gently massaged. A test dose must be given followed by doses at weekly intervals until there is definite evidence of remission. In patients who do respond, the interval between injections is then gradually increased to 4 weeks and treatment is continued for up to 5 years after complete remission. If relapse occurs the dosage frequency may be immediately increased and only once control has been obtained again should the dosage frequency be decreased; if no response is seen within 2 months, alternative treatment should be sought. It is important to avoid complete relapse since second courses of gold are not usually effective.

Penicillamine

Penicillamine has a similar action to gold. More patients are able to continue treatment than with gold but side-effects are common.

Patients should be warned not to expect improvement for at least 6 to 12 weeks after treatment is initiated. Penicillamine should be discontinued if there is no improvement within 1 year.

Sulfasalazine

Sulfasalazine has a beneficial effect in suppressing the inflammatory activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Sulfasalazine may also be used by specialists, in the management of psoriatic arthritis affecting peripheral joints [unlicensed indication]. Haematological abnormalities occur usually in the first 3 to 6 months of treatment and are reversible on cessation of treatment.

Antimalarials

The antimalarial hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis of moderate inflammatory activity; chloroquine is also licensed for treating inflammatory disorders but is used much less frequently and is generally reserved for use if other drugs have failed.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate are effective for mild systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly involving the skin and joints. These drugs should not be used for psoriatic arthritis. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate are better tolerated than gold or penicillamine. Retinopathy rarely occurs provided that the recommended doses are not exceeded; in the elderly it is difficult to distinguish drug-induced retinopathy from changes of ageing.

Mepacrine hydrochloride is sometimes used in discoid lupus erythematosus [unlicensed].

Drugs affecting the immune response

Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug suitable for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Azathioprine, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, and the cytokine modulators are considered more toxic and they are used in cases that have not responded to other disease-modifying drugs.

Methotrexate is usually given by mouth once a week, adjusted according to response. In patients who experience mucosal or gastro-intestinal side-effects with methotrexate, folic acid given every week [unlicensed indication], on a different day from the methotrexate, may help to reduce the frequency of such side-effects.

Leflunomide acts on the immune system as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Its therapeutic effect starts after 4–6 weeks and improvement may continue for a further 4–6 months. Leflunomide, which is similar in efficacy to sulfasalazine and methotrexate, may be chosen when these drugs cannot be used. 

Ciclosporin is licensed for severe active rheumatoid arthritis when conventional second-line therapy is inappropriate or ineffective. There is some evidence that ciclosporin may retard the rate of erosive progression and improve symptom control in those who respond only partially to methotrexate.

Cyclophosphamide may be used for rheumatoid arthritis with severe systemic manifestations [unlicensed indication]; it is toxic and regular blood counts (including platelet counts) should be carried out. Cyclophosphamide can also be given for severe systemic rheumatoid arthritis and for other connective tissue diseases (especially with active vasculitis).

Drugs that affect the immune response are also used in the management of severe cases of systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue disorders. They are often given in conjunction with corticosteroids for patients with severe or progressive renal disease. They may be used in cases of polymyositis that are resistant to corticosteroids. They are used for their corticosteroid-sparing effect in patients whose corticosteroid requirements are excessive. Azathioprine is usually used.

In the specialist management of psoriatic arthritis affecting peripheral joints, leflunomide, methotrexate, or azathioprine [unlicensed indication] may be used.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Many children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile chronic arthritis) do not require disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Methotrexate is effective; sulfasalazine is an alternative [unlicensed indication] but it should be avoided in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Gold and penicillamine are no longer used. Cytokine modulators have a role in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Cytokine modulators

Cytokine modulators should be used under specialist supervision.

Adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab inhibit the activity of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).

Adalimumab is licensed for moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis when response to other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (including methotrexate) has been inadequate; it is also licensed for severe, active, and progressive disease in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, adalimumab should be used in combination with methotrexate, but it can be given alone if methotrexate is inappropriate. Adalimumab is also licensed for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis and severe active ankylosing spondylitis that have not responded adequately to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. It is also licensed for the treatment of severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis but with objective signs of inflammation, in patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant of NSAIDs. Adalimumab also has a role in inflammatory bowel disease and plaque psoriasis.

Certolizumab pegol is licensed for use in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis when response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (including methotrexate) has been inadequate. Certolizumab pegol can be used in combination with methotrexate, or as a monotherapy if methotrexate is not tolerated or is contra-indicated. Certolizumab pegol is also licensed for the treatment of severe active ankylosing spondylitis in patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant of NSAIDs. It is also licensed for the treatment of severe active axial spondyloarthritis, without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis but with objective signs of inflammation, in patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant of NSAIDs.

Etanercept is licensed for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis either alone or in combination with methotrexate when the response to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is inadequate and in severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in patients not previously treated with methotrexate. It is also licensed for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis inadequately responsive to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and for severe ankylosing spondylitis inadequately responsive to conventional therapy. Etanercept also has a role in plaque psoriasis.

Golimumab is licensed in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis when response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (including methotrexate has been inadequate; it is also licensed in combination with methotrexate for patients with severe, active, and progressive rheumatoid arthritis not previously treated with methotrexate. Golimumab is also licensed for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis, as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate, when response to DMARD therapy has been inadequate; it is also licensed for the treatment of severe active ankylosing spondylitis when there is an inadequate response to conventional treatment.

Infliximab is licensed for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate when the response to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate, is inadequate; it is also licensed in combination with methotrexate for patients not previously treated with methotrexate or other DMARDs who have severe, active, and progressive rheumatoid arthritis. Infliximab is also licensed for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, in patients with severe axial symptoms who have not responded adequately to conventional therapy, and in combination with methotrexate (or alone if methotrexate is not tolerated or is contra-indicated) for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis which has not responded adequately to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Rituximab is licensed in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis in patients whose condition has not responded adequately to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (including one or more tumour necrosis factor inhibitors) or who are intolerant of them. Rituximab has a role in malignant disease.

Abatacept prevents the full activation of T-lymphocytes. It is licensed for moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, in patients unresponsive to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (including methotrexate or a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor). Abatacept is not recommended for use in combination with TNF inhibitors.

Anakinra inhibits the activity of interleukin-1. Anakinra (in combination with methotrexate) is licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis which has not responded to methotrexate alone. Anakinra is not recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis except when used in a controlled long-term clinical study. Patients who are already receiving anakinra for rheumatoid arthritis should continue treatment until they and their specialist consider it appropriate to stop.

Belimumab inhibits the activity of B-lymphocyte stimulator. Belimumab is licensed as adjunctive therapy in patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus with a high degree of disease activity despite standard therapy. 

Tocilizumab antagonises the actions of interleukin-6. Tocilizumab is licensed for use in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis when response to at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug or tumour necrosis factor inhibitor has been inadequate, or in those who are intolerant of these drugs. Tocilizumab can be used in combination with methotrexate, or as monotherapy if methotrexate is not tolerated or is contra-indicated.

Ustekinumab inhibits the activity of interleukins 12 and 23. It is licensed for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (in combination with methotrexate or alone) in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Acne</p>
    <p>Treatment of acne should be commenced early to prevent scarring. Patients should be counselled that an improvement may not be seen for at least a couple of months. The choice of treatment depends on whether the acne is predominantly inflammatory or comedonal and its severity.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Mild to moderate acne</i> is generally treated with topical preparations. Systemic treatment with oral antibacterials is generally used for <i>moderate to severe acne</i> or where topical preparations are not tolerated or are ineffective or where application to the site is difficult. Another oral preparation used for acne is the hormone treatment <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-cyprindiol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7860\">co-cyprindiol</xref> ( cyproterone acetate with ethinylestradiol); it is for women only.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Severe acne</i>, acne unresponsive to prolonged courses of oral antibacterials, scarring, or acne associated with psychological problems calls for early referral to a consultant dermatologist who may prescribe <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isotretinoin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7832\">isotretinoin</xref> for administration by mouth.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Topical preparations for acne</p>
    <p>In mild to moderate acne, comedones and inflamed lesions respond well to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzoyl-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7795\">benzoyl peroxide</xref> or to a topical retinoid. Alternatively, topical application of an antibacterial such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/erythromycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3510\">erythromycin</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clindamycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3526\">clindamycin</xref> may be effective for inflammatory acne. If topical preparations prove inadequate, oral preparations may be needed.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzoyl-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7795\">Benzoyl peroxide</xref> is effective in mild to moderate acne. Both comedones and inflamed lesions respond well to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzoyl-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7795\">benzoyl peroxide</xref>. The lower concentrations seem to be as effective as higher concentrations in reducing inflammation. It is usual to start with a lower strength and to increase the concentration of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzoyl-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7795\">benzoyl peroxide</xref> gradually. Adverse effects include local skin irritation, particularly when therapy is initiated, but the scaling and redness often subside with treatment continued at a reduced frequency of application. If the acne does not respond after 2 months then use of a topical antibacterial should be considered.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/azelaic-acid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7806\">Azelaic acid</xref> has antimicrobial and anticomedonal properties. It may be an alternative to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzoyl-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7795\">benzoyl peroxide</xref> or to a topical retinoid for treating mild to moderate comedonal acne, particularly of the face. Some patients prefer <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/azelaic-acid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7806\">azelaic acid</xref> because it is less likely to cause local irritation than <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzoyl-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7795\">benzoyl peroxide</xref>.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Topical antibacterials for acne</p>
      <p>For many patients with mild to moderate inflammatory acne, topical antibacterials may be no more effective than topical <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/benzoyl-peroxide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7795\">benzoyl peroxide</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tretinoin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP5584\">tretinoin</xref>.

Treatment of acne should be commenced early to prevent scarring. Patients should be counselled that an improvement may not be seen for at least a couple of months. The choice of treatment depends on whether the acne is predominantly inflammatory or comedonal and its severity.

Mild to moderate acne is generally treated with topical preparations. Systemic treatment with oral antibacterials is generally used for moderate to severe acne or where topical preparations are not tolerated or are ineffective or where application to the site is difficult. Another oral preparation used for acne is the hormone treatment co-cyprindiol ( cyproterone acetate with ethinylestradiol); it is for women only.

Severe acne, acne unresponsive to prolonged courses of oral antibacterials, scarring, or acne associated with psychological problems calls for early referral to a consultant dermatologist who may prescribe isotretinoin for administration by mouth.

Topical preparations for acne

In mild to moderate acne, comedones and inflamed lesions respond well to benzoyl peroxide or to a topical retinoid. Alternatively, topical application of an antibacterial such as erythromycin or clindamycin may be effective for inflammatory acne. If topical preparations prove inadequate, oral preparations may be needed.

Benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid

Benzoyl peroxide is effective in mild to moderate acne. Both comedones and inflamed lesions respond well to benzoyl peroxide. The lower concentrations seem to be as effective as higher concentrations in reducing inflammation. It is usual to start with a lower strength and to increase the concentration of benzoyl peroxide gradually. Adverse effects include local skin irritation, particularly when therapy is initiated, but the scaling and redness often subside with treatment continued at a reduced frequency of application. If the acne does not respond after 2 months then use of a topical antibacterial should be considered.

Azelaic acid has antimicrobial and anticomedonal properties. It may be an alternative to benzoyl peroxide or to a topical retinoid for treating mild to moderate comedonal acne, particularly of the face. Some patients prefer azelaic acid because it is less likely to cause local irritation than benzoyl peroxide.

Topical antibacterials for acne

For many patients with mild to moderate inflammatory acne, topical antibacterials may be no more effective than topical benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin. Topical antibacterials are probably best reserved for patients who wish to avoid oral antibacterials or who cannot tolerate them. Topical preparations of erythromycin and clindamycin are effective for inflammatory acne. Topical antibacterials can produce mild irritation of the skin, and on rare occasions cause sensitisation; gastro-intestinal disturbances have been reported with topical clindamycin.

Antibacterial resistance of Propionibacterium acnes is increasing; there is cross-resistance between erythromycin and clindamycin. To avoid development of resistance:

when possible use non-antibiotic antimicrobials (such as benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid);avoid concomitant treatment with different oral and topical antibacterials;if a particular antibacterial is effective, use it for repeat courses if needed (short intervening courses of benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid may eliminate any resistant propionibacteria);do not continue treatment for longer than necessary (however, treatment with a topical preparation should be continued for at least 6 months).Some manufacturers of topical antibacterial preparations for acne advise that preparations containing alcohol are not suitable for use with benzoyl peroxide.

Topical retinoids and related preparations for acne

Topical tretinoin, its isomer isotretinoin, and adapalene (a retinoid-like drug), are useful for treating comedones and inflammatory lesions in mild to moderate acne. Several months of treatment may be needed to achieve an optimal response and the treatment should be continued until no new lesions develop. Isotretinoin is given by mouth in severe acne.

Other topical preparations for acne

Preparations containing aluminium oxide are not considered beneficial in acne.

A topical preparation of nicotinamide is available for inflammatory acne.

Oral preparations for acne

Systemic antibacterial treatment is useful for inflammatory acne if topical treatment is not adequately effective or if it is inappropriate. Anticomedonal treatment (e.g. with topical benzoyl peroxide) may also be required.

Either oxytetracyclineor tetracycline is usually given for acne. If there is no improvement after the first 3 months another oral antibacterial should be used. Maximum improvement usually occurs after 4 to 6 months but in more severe cases treatment may need to be continued for 2 years or longer.

Doxycycline and lymecycline are alternatives to tetracycline.

Although minocycline is as effective as other tetracyclines for acne, it is associated with a greater risk of lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. Minocycline sometimes causes irreversible pigmentation; it is given in a once or twice daily dose.

Erythromycin in a twice daily dose is an alternative for the management of acne but propionibacteria strains resistant to erythromycin are becoming widespread and this may explain poor response.

Trimethoprim may be used for acne resistant to other antibacterials [unlicensed indication]. Prolonged treatment with trimethoprim may depress haematopoiesis; it should generally be initiated by specialists.

Concomitant use of different topical and systemic antibacterials is undesirable owing to the increased likelihood of the development of bacterial resistance.

Hormone treatment for acne

Co-cyprindiol (cyproterone acetate with ethinylestradiol) contains an anti-androgen. It is licensed for use in women with moderate to severe acne that has not responded to topical therapy or oral antibacterials, and for moderately severe hirsutism. Although it is an effective hormonal contraceptive, it should not be used solely for contraception.

Improvement of acne with co-cyprindiol probably occurs because of decreased sebum secretion which is under androgen control. Some women with moderately severe hirsutism may also benefit because hair growth is also androgen-dependent.

Oral retinoid for acne

The retinoid isotretinoin reduces sebum secretion. It is used for the systemic treatment of nodulo-cystic and conglobate acne, severe acne, scarring, acne which has not responded to an adequate course of a systemic antibacterial, or acne which is associated with psychological problems. It is also useful in women who develop acne in the third or fourth decades of life, since late onset acne is frequently unresponsive to antibacterials.

Isotretinoin is a toxic drug that should be prescribed only by, or under the supervision of, a consultant dermatologist. It is given for at least 16 weeks; repeat courses are not normally required.

Side-effects of isotretinoin include severe dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, nose bleeds, and joint pains. The drug is teratogenic and must not be given to women of child-bearing age unless they practise effective contraception (oral progestogen-only contraceptives not considered effective) and then only after detailed assessment and explanation by the physician. Women must also be registered with a pregnancy prevention programme.

Although a causal link between isotretinoin use and psychiatric changes (including suicidal ideation) has not been established, the possibility should be considered before initiating treatment; if psychiatric changes occur during treatment, isotretinoin should be stopped, the prescriber informed, and specialist psychiatric advice should be sought.

Rosacea

Rosacea is not comedonal (but may exist with acne which may be comedonal). Brimonidine tartrate is licensed for the treatment of facial erythema in rosacea. The pustules and papules of rosacea respond to topical azelaic acid, topical ivermectin or to topical metronidazole. Alternatively oral administration of oxytetracycline or tetracycline, or erythromycin, can be used; courses usually last 6–12 weeks and are repeated intermittently. Doxycycline can be used [unlicensed indication] if oxytetracycline or tetracycline is inappropriate (e.g. in renal impairment). A modified-release preparation of doxycycline is licensed in low daily doses for the treatment of facial rosacea. Isotretinoin is occasionally given in refractory cases [unlicensed indication]. Camouflagers may be required for the redness.

Hirsutism

Hirsutism may result from hormonal disorders or as a side-effect of drugs such as minoxidil, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, androgens, danazol, and progestogens.

Weight loss can reduce hirsutism in obese women.

Women should be advised about local methods of hair removal, and in the mildest cases this may be all that is required.

Eflornithine an antiprotozoal drug, inhibits the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase in hair follicles. Topical eflornithine can be used as an adjunct to laser therapy for facial hirsutism in women.

Co-cyprindiol may be effective for moderately severe hirsutism. Metformin hydrochloride is an alternative in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [unlicensed indication]. Systemic treatment is required for 6–12 months before benefit is seen.

Androgenetic alopecia

Finasteride is licensed for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Continuous use for 3–6 months is required before benefit is seen, and effects are reversed 6–12 months after treatment is discontinued.

Topical application of minoxidil may stimulate limited hair growth in a small proportion of adults but only for as long as it is used.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Oestrogens and HRT</p>
    <p>Oestrogens are necessary for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics; they also stimulate myometrial hypertrophy with endometrial hyperplasia.</p>
    <p>In terms of oestrogenic activity <i>natural oestrogens</i> (<xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/estradiol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP94655\">estradiol</xref> (oestradiol), estrone (oestrone), and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/estriol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP94656\">estriol</xref> (oestriol)) have a more appropriate profile for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) than <i>synthetic oestrogens</i> (<xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ethinylestradiol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4479\">ethinylestradiol</xref> (ethinyloestradiol) and mestranol). <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tibolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4475\">Tibolone</xref> has oestrogenic, progestogenic and weak androgenic activity.</p>
    <p>Oestrogen therapy is given cyclically or continuously for a number of gynaecological conditions. If long-term therapy is required in women with a uterus, a progestogen should normally be added to reduce the risk of cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium (or of endometriotic foci in women who have had a hysterectomy) and possible transformation to cancer.</p>
    <p>Oestrogens are no longer used to suppress lactation because of their association with thromboembolism.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Hormone replacement therapy</p>
    <p>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with small doses of an oestrogen (together with a progestogen in women with a uterus) is appropriate for alleviating menopausal symptoms such as vaginal atrophy or vasomotor instability. Oestrogen given systemically in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal period or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tibolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4475\">tibolone</xref> given in the postmenopausal period also diminish postmenopausal osteoporosis but other drugs are preferred. Menopausal atrophic vaginitis may respond to a short course of a topical vaginal oestrogen preparation used for a few weeks and repeated if necessary.</p>
    <p>Systemic therapy with an oestrogen or drugs with oestrogenic properties alleviates the symptoms of oestrogen deficiency such as vasomotor symptoms. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/tibolone.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4475\">Tibolone</xref> combines oestrogenic and progestogenic activity with weak androgenic activity; it is given continuously, without cyclical progestogen.</p>
    <p>HRT may be used in women with early natural or surgical menopause (before age 45 years), since they are at high risk of osteoporosis. For early menopause, HRT can be given until the approximate age of natural menopause (i.e. until age 50 years). Alternatives to HRT should be considered if osteoporosis is the main concern.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clonidine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1072\">Clonidine hydrochloride</xref> may be used to reduce vasomotor symptoms in women who cannot take an oestrogen, but <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clonidine-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP1072\">clonidine hydrochloride</xref> may cause unacceptable side-effects.</p>
    <p>HRT increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, stroke, endometrial cancer (reduced by a progestogen), breast cancer, and ovarian cancer; there is an increased risk of coronary heart disease in women who start combined HRT more than 10 years after menopause. For details of these risks see HRT Risk table.</p>
    <p>The minimum effective dose of HRT should be used for the shortest duration. Treatment should be reviewed at least annually and for osteoporosis alternative treatments considered. HRT does not prevent coronary heart disease or protect against a decline in cognitive function and it should not be prescribed for these purposes. Experience of treating women over 65 years with HRT is limited.</p>
    <p>For the treatment of menopausal symptoms the benefits of short-term HRT outweigh the risks in the majority of women, especially in those aged under 60 years.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of breast cancer</p>
      <p>It is estimated that using all types of HRT, including tibolone, increases the risk of breast cancer within 1–2 years of initiating treatment. The increased risk is related to the duration of HRT use (but not to the age at which HRT is started) and this excess risk disappears within 5 years of stopping. Radiological detection of breast cancer can be made more difficult as mammographic density can increase with HRT use; tibolone has only a limited effect on mammographic density.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of endometrial cancer</p>
      <p>The increased risk of endometrial cancer depends on the dose and duration of oestrogen-only HRT. In women with a uterus, the addition of a progestogen cyclically (for at least 10 days per 28-day cycle) reduces the additional risk of endometrial cancer; this additional risk is eliminated if a progestogen is given continuously. However, this should be weighed against the increased risk of breast cancer.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of ovarian cancer</p>
      <p>Long-term use of combined HRT or oestrogen-only HRT is associated with a small increased risk of ovarian cancer; this excess risk disappears within a few years of stopping.</p>

Oestrogens are necessary for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics; they also stimulate myometrial hypertrophy with endometrial hyperplasia.

In terms of oestrogenic activity natural oestrogens (estradiol (oestradiol), estrone (oestrone), and estriol (oestriol)) have a more appropriate profile for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) than synthetic oestrogens (ethinylestradiol (ethinyloestradiol) and mestranol). Tibolone has oestrogenic, progestogenic and weak androgenic activity.

Oestrogen therapy is given cyclically or continuously for a number of gynaecological conditions. If long-term therapy is required in women with a uterus, a progestogen should normally be added to reduce the risk of cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium (or of endometriotic foci in women who have had a hysterectomy) and possible transformation to cancer.

Oestrogens are no longer used to suppress lactation because of their association with thromboembolism.

Hormone replacement therapy

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with small doses of an oestrogen (together with a progestogen in women with a uterus) is appropriate for alleviating menopausal symptoms such as vaginal atrophy or vasomotor instability. Oestrogen given systemically in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal period or tibolone given in the postmenopausal period also diminish postmenopausal osteoporosis but other drugs are preferred. Menopausal atrophic vaginitis may respond to a short course of a topical vaginal oestrogen preparation used for a few weeks and repeated if necessary.

Systemic therapy with an oestrogen or drugs with oestrogenic properties alleviates the symptoms of oestrogen deficiency such as vasomotor symptoms. Tibolone combines oestrogenic and progestogenic activity with weak androgenic activity; it is given continuously, without cyclical progestogen.

HRT may be used in women with early natural or surgical menopause (before age 45 years), since they are at high risk of osteoporosis. For early menopause, HRT can be given until the approximate age of natural menopause (i.e. until age 50 years). Alternatives to HRT should be considered if osteoporosis is the main concern.

Clonidine hydrochloride may be used to reduce vasomotor symptoms in women who cannot take an oestrogen, but clonidine hydrochloride may cause unacceptable side-effects.

HRT increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, stroke, endometrial cancer (reduced by a progestogen), breast cancer, and ovarian cancer; there is an increased risk of coronary heart disease in women who start combined HRT more than 10 years after menopause. For details of these risks see HRT Risk table.

The minimum effective dose of HRT should be used for the shortest duration. Treatment should be reviewed at least annually and for osteoporosis alternative treatments considered. HRT does not prevent coronary heart disease or protect against a decline in cognitive function and it should not be prescribed for these purposes. Experience of treating women over 65 years with HRT is limited.

For the treatment of menopausal symptoms the benefits of short-term HRT outweigh the risks in the majority of women, especially in those aged under 60 years.

Risk of breast cancer

It is estimated that using all types of HRT, including tibolone, increases the risk of breast cancer within 1–2 years of initiating treatment. The increased risk is related to the duration of HRT use (but not to the age at which HRT is started) and this excess risk disappears within 5 years of stopping. Radiological detection of breast cancer can be made more difficult as mammographic density can increase with HRT use; tibolone has only a limited effect on mammographic density.

Risk of endometrial cancer

The increased risk of endometrial cancer depends on the dose and duration of oestrogen-only HRT. In women with a uterus, the addition of a progestogen cyclically (for at least 10 days per 28-day cycle) reduces the additional risk of endometrial cancer; this additional risk is eliminated if a progestogen is given continuously. However, this should be weighed against the increased risk of breast cancer.

Risk of ovarian cancer

Long-term use of combined HRT or oestrogen-only HRT is associated with a small increased risk of ovarian cancer; this excess risk disappears within a few years of stopping.

Risk of venous thromboembolism

Women using combined or oestrogen-only HRT are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and of pulmonary embolism especially in the first year of use. In women who have predisposing factors (such as a personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, severe varicose veins, obesity, trauma, or prolonged bed-rest) it is prudent to review the need for HRT, as in some cases the risks of HRT may exceed the benefits. Travel involving prolonged immobility further increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

Risk of stroke

Risk of stroke increases with age, therefore older women have a greater absolute risk of stroke. Combined HRT or oestrogen-only HRT slightly increases the risk of stroke. Tibolone increases the risk of stroke about 2.2 times from the first year of treatment.

Risk of coronary heart disease

HRT does not prevent coronary heart disease and should not be prescribed for this purpose. There is an increased risk of coronary heart disease in women who start combined HRT more than 10 years after menopause. Although very little information is available on the risk of coronary heart disease in younger women who start HRT close to the menopause, studies suggest a lower relative risk compared with older women.

Choice

The choice of HRT for an individual depends on an overall balance of indication, risk, and convenience. A woman with a uterus normally requires oestrogen with cyclical progestogen for the last 12 to 14 days of the cycle or a preparation which involves continuous administration of an oestrogen and a progestogen (or one which provides both oestrogenic and progestogenic activity in a single preparation). Continuous combined preparations or tibolone are not suitable for use in the perimenopause or within 12 months of the last menstrual period; women who use such preparations may bleed irregularly in the early stages of treatment—if bleeding continues endometrial abnormality should be ruled out and consideration given to changing to cyclical HRT.

An oestrogen alone is suitable for continuous use in women without a uterus. However, in endometriosis, endometrial foci may remain despite hysterectomy and the addition of a progestogen should be considered in these circumstances.

An oestrogen may be given by mouth or by transdermal administration, which avoids first-pass metabolism.

Surgery

Major surgery under general anaesthesia, including orthopaedic and vascular leg surgery, is a predisposing factor for venous thromboembolism and it may be prudent to stop HRT 4–6 weeks before surgery; it should be restarted only after full mobilisation. If HRT is continued or if discontinuation is not possible (e.g. in non-elective surgery), prophylaxis with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin and graduated compression hosiery is advised.

Reasons to stop HRT

Hormone replacement therapy should be stopped (pending investigation and treatment), if any of the following occur:

sudden severe chest pain (even if not radiating to left arm);sudden breathlessness (or cough with blood-stained sputum);unexplained swelling or severe pain in calf of one leg;severe stomach pain;serious neurological effects including unusual severe, prolonged headache especially if first time or getting progressively worse or sudden partial or complete loss of vision or sudden disturbance of hearing or other perceptual disorders or dysphasia or bad fainting attack or collapse or first unexplained epileptic seizure or weakness, motor disturbances, very marked numbness suddenly affecting one side or one part of body;hepatitis, jaundice, liver enlargement;blood pressure above systolic 160 mmHg or diastolic 95 mmHg;prolonged immobility after surgery or leg injury;detection of a risk factor which contra-indicates treatmentEthinylestradiol

Ethinylestradiol (ethinyloestradiol) is licensed for short-term treatment of symptoms of oestrogen deficiency, for osteoporosis prophylaxis if other drugs cannot be used and for the treatment of female hypogonadism and menstrual disorders.

Ethinylestradiol is occasionally used under specialist supervision for the management of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (but evidence of benefit is limited). It is also used licensed for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer.

Raloxifene

Raloxifene hydrochloride is licensed for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis; unlike hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene hydrochloride does not reduce menopausal vasomotor symptoms.

Raloxifene hydrochloride may reduce the incidence of oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer but its role in established breast cancer is not yet clear. The manufacturer advises avoiding its use during treatment for breast cancer.

Progestogens and progesterone receptor modulators

There are two main groups of progestogen, progesterone and its analogues (dydrogesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate) and testosterone analogues (norethisterone and norgestrel). The newer progestogens (desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene) are all derivatives of norgestrel; levonorgestrel is the active isomer of norgestrel and has twice its potency. Progesterone and its analogues are less androgenic than the testosterone derivatives and neither progesterone nor dydrogesterone causes virilisation.

Where endometriosis requires drug treatment, it may respond to a progestogen, e.g. norethisterone, administered on a continuous basis. Danazol and gonadorelin analogues are also available.

Although oral progestogens have been used widely for menorrhagia they are relatively ineffective compared with tranexamic acid or, particularly where dysmenorrhoea is also a factor, mefenamic acid; the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system may be particularly useful for women also requiring contraception. Oral progestogens have also been used for severe dysmenorrhoea, but where contraception is also required in younger women the best choice is a combined oral contraceptive.

Progestogens have also been advocated for the alleviation of premenstrual symptoms, but no convincing physiological basis for such treatment has been shown.

Progestogens have been used for the prevention of miscarriage in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage but there is no evidence of benefit and they are not recommended for this purpose. In pregnant women with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome who have suffered recurrent miscarriage, administration of low-dose aspirin and a prophylactic dose of a low molecular weight heparin may decrease the risk of fetal loss (use under specialist supervision only).

Hormone replacement therapy

In women with a uterus a progestogen needs to be added to long-term oestrogen therapy for hormone replacement, to prevent cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium and possible transformation to cancer; it can be added on a cyclical or a continuous basis. Combined packs incorporating suitable progestogen tablets are available.

Oral contraception

Desogestrel, gestodene, levonorgestrel, norethisterone, and norgestimate are used in combined oral contraceptives and in progestogen-only contraceptives.

Cancer

Progestogens also have a role in neoplastic disease.

Progesterone receptor modulators

Ulipristal acetate is a progesterone receptor modulator with a partial progesterone antagonist effect. Ulipristal acetate is used in the pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids; it is also used as an hormonal emergency contraceptive.

    <p>Both vehicle and active ingredients are important in the treatment of skin conditions; the vehicle alone may have more than a mere placebo effect. The vehicle affects the degree of hydration of the skin, has a mild anti-inflammatory effect, and aids the penetration of active drug.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Applications</b> are usually viscous solutions, emulsions, or suspensions for application to the skin (including the scalp) or nails.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Collodions</b> are painted on the skin and allowed to dry to leave a flexible film over the site of application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Creams</b> are emulsions of oil and water and are generally well absorbed into the skin. They may contain an antimicrobial preservative unless the active ingredient or basis is intrinsically bactericidal and fungicidal. Generally, creams are cosmetically more acceptable than ointments because they are less greasy and easier to apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Gels</b> consist of active ingredients in suitable hydrophilic or hydrophobic bases; they generally have a high water content. Gels are particularly suitable for application to the face and scalp.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Lotions</b> have a cooling effect and may be preferred to ointments or creams for application over a hairy area. Lotions in alcoholic basis can sting if used on broken skin. <i>Shake lotions</i> (such as calamine lotion) contain insoluble powders which leave a deposit on the skin surface.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ointments</b> are greasy preparations which are normally anhydrous and insoluble in water, and are more occlusive than creams. They are particularly suitable for chronic, dry lesions. The most commonly used ointment bases consist of soft paraffin or a combination of soft, liquid, and hard paraffin. Some ointment bases have both <i>hydrophilic and lipophilic</i> properties; they may have occlusive properties on the skin surface, encourage hydration, and also be miscible with water; they often have a mild anti-inflammatory effect. <i>Water-soluble ointments</i> contain macrogols which are freely soluble in water and are therefore readily washed off; they have a limited but useful role where ready removal is desirable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Pastes</b> are stiff preparations containing a high proportion of finely powdered solids such as zinc oxide and starch suspended in an ointment. They are used for circumscribed lesions such as those which occur in lichen simplex, chronic eczema, or psoriasis. They are less occlusive than ointments and can be used to protect inflamed, lichenified, or excoriated skin.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Dusting powders</b> are used only rarely. They reduce friction between opposing skin surfaces. Dusting powders should not be applied to moist areas because they can cake and abrade the skin. Talc is a lubricant but it does not absorb moisture; it can cause respiratory irritation. Starch is less lubricant but absorbs water.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Dilution</p>
      <p>The BP directs that creams and ointments should <b>not</b> normally be diluted but that should dilution be necessary care should be taken, in particular, to prevent microbial contamination. The appropriate diluent should be used and heating should be avoided during mixing; excessive dilution may affect the stability of some creams. Diluted creams should normally be used within 2 weeks of preparation.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Antibacterial preparations</p>
    <p>
      <i>Cellulitis</i>, a rapidly spreading deeply seated inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, requires systemic antibacterial treatment. Lower leg infections or infections spreading around wounds are almost always cellulitis. <i>Erysipelas</i>, a superficial infection with clearly defined edges (and often affecting the face), is also treated with a systemic antibacterial.</p>
    <p>In the community, acute <i>impetigo</i> on small areas of the skin may be treated by short-term topical application of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/fusidic-acid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP6825\">fusidic acid</xref>; <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mupirocin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7973\">mupirocin</xref> should be used only to treat meticillin-resistant <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i></ph>. If the impetigo is extensive or longstanding, an oral antibacterial such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/flucloxacillin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3315\">flucloxacillin</xref> (or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clarithromycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3505\">clarithromycin</xref> in penicillin allergy) should be used. Mild antiseptics can be used to soften crusts.</p>
    <p>Although many antibacterial drugs are available in topical preparations, some are potentially hazardous and frequently their use is not necessary if adequate hygienic measures can be taken. Moreover, not all skin conditions that are oozing, crusted, or characterised by pustules are actually infected. Topical antibacterials should be <b>avoided</b> on <i>leg ulcers</i> unless used in short courses for defined infections; treatment of bacterial colonisation is generally inappropriate.</p>
    <p>To minimise the development of resistant organisms it is advisable to limit the choice of antibacterials applied topically to those not used systemically. Unfortunately some of these, for example <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/neomycin-sulfate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3489\">neomycin sulfate</xref>, may cause sensitisation, and there is cross-sensitivity with other aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/gentamicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3478\">gentamicin</xref>. If <i>large areas of skin</i> are being treated, ototoxicity may also be a hazard with aminoglycoside antibiotics (and also with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/polymyxins.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7979\">polymyxins</xref>), particularly in children, in the elderly, and in those with renal impairment. <i>Resistant organisms</i> are more common in hospitals, and whenever possible swabs should be taken for bacteriological examination before beginning treatment.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/mupirocin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP7973\">Mupirocin</xref> is not related to any other antibacterial in use; it is effective for skin infections, particularly those due to Gram-positive organisms but it is not indicated for pseudomonal infection.

Cellulitis, a rapidly spreading deeply seated inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, requires systemic antibacterial treatment. Lower leg infections or infections spreading around wounds are almost always cellulitis. Erysipelas, a superficial infection with clearly defined edges (and often affecting the face), is also treated with a systemic antibacterial.

In the community, acute impetigo on small areas of the skin may be treated by short-term topical application of fusidic acid; mupirocin should be used only to treat meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. If the impetigo is extensive or longstanding, an oral antibacterial such as flucloxacillin (or clarithromycin in penicillin allergy) should be used. Mild antiseptics can be used to soften crusts.

Although many antibacterial drugs are available in topical preparations, some are potentially hazardous and frequently their use is not necessary if adequate hygienic measures can be taken. Moreover, not all skin conditions that are oozing, crusted, or characterised by pustules are actually infected. Topical antibacterials should be avoided on leg ulcers unless used in short courses for defined infections; treatment of bacterial colonisation is generally inappropriate.

To minimise the development of resistant organisms it is advisable to limit the choice of antibacterials applied topically to those not used systemically. Unfortunately some of these, for example neomycin sulfate, may cause sensitisation, and there is cross-sensitivity with other aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin. If large areas of skin are being treated, ototoxicity may also be a hazard with aminoglycoside antibiotics (and also with polymyxins), particularly in children, in the elderly, and in those with renal impairment. Resistant organisms are more common in hospitals, and whenever possible swabs should be taken for bacteriological examination before beginning treatment.

Mupirocin is not related to any other antibacterial in use; it is effective for skin infections, particularly those due to Gram-positive organisms but it is not indicated for pseudomonal infection. Although Staphylococcus aureus strains with low-level resistance to mupirocin are emerging, it is generally useful in infections resistant to other antibacterials. To avoid the development of resistance, mupirocin or fusidic acid should not be used for longer than 10 days and local microbiology advice should be sought before using it in hospital. In the presence of mupirocin-resistant MRSA infection, a topical antiseptic such as povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, or alcohol can be used; their use should be discussed with the local microbiologist.

Retapamulin can be used for impetigo and other superficial bacterial skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes that are resistant to first-line topical antibacterials. However, it is not effective against MRSA.

Silver sulfadiazine is used in the treatment of infected burns.

Antibacterial preparations also used systemically

Fusidic acid is a narrow-spectrum antibacterial used for staphylococcal infections. Fusidic acid has a role in the treatment of impetigo.

An ointment containing fusidic acid is used in the fissures of angular cheilitis when associated with staphylococcal infection. See Oropharyngeal fungal infections for further information on angular cheilitis.

Metronidazole is used topically for rosacea and to reduce the odour associated with anaerobic infections; oral metronidazole is used to treat wounds infected with anaerobic bacteria.

Antifungal preparations

Most localised fungal infections are treated with topical preparations. To prevent relapse, local antifungal treatment should be continued for 1–2 weeks after the disappearance of all signs of infection. Systemic therapy is necessary for scalp infection or if the skin infection is widespread, disseminated, or intractable; although topical therapy may be used to treat some nail infections, systemic therapy is more effective. Skin scrapings should be examined if systemic therapy is being considered or where there is doubt about the diagnosis.

Dermatophytoses

Ringworm infection can affect the scalp (tinea capitis), body (tinea corporis), groin (tinea cruris), hand (tinea manuum), foot (tinea pedis, athlete’s foot), or nail (tinea unguium). Scalp infection requires systemic treatment; additional application of a topical antifungal, during the early stages of treatment, may reduce the risk of transmission. A topical antifungal can also be used to treat asymptomatic carriers of scalp ringworm. Most other local ringworm infections can be treated adequately with topical antifungal preparations (including shampoos). The imidazole antifungals clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, ketoconazole, and miconazole are all effective. Terbinafine cream is also effective but it is more expensive. Other topical antifungals include griseofulvin and the undecenoates. Compound benzoic acid ointment (Whitfield’s ointment) has been used for ringworm infections but it is cosmetically less acceptable than proprietary preparations. Topical preparations for athlete’s foot containing tolnaftate are on sale to the public.

Antifungal dusting powders are of little therapeutic value in the treatment of fungal skin infections and may cause skin irritation; they may have some role in preventing re-infection.

Antifungal treatment may not be necessary in asymptomatic patients with tinea infection of the nails. If treatment is necessary, a systemic antifungal is more effective than topical therapy. However, topical application of amorolfine or tioconazole may be useful for treating early onychomycosis when involvement is limited to mild distal disease, or for superficial white onychomycosis, or where there are contra-indications to systemic therapy.

Pityriasis versicolor

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor can be treated with ketoconazole shampoo. Alternatively, selenium sulfide shampoo [unlicensed indication] can be used as a lotion (diluting with a small amount of water can reduce irritation) and left on the affected area for 10 minutes before rinsing off; it should be applied once daily for 7 days, and the course repeated if necessary.

Topical imidazole antifungals such as clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, ketoconazole, and miconazole, or topical terbinafine are alternatives, but large quantities may be required.

If topical therapy fails, or if the infection is widespread, pityriasis versicolor is treated systemically with a triazole antifungal. Relapse is common, especially in the immunocompromised.

Candidiasis

Candidal skin infections can be treated with a topical imidazole antifungal, such as clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, ketoconazole, or miconazole; topical terbinafine is an alternative. Topical application of nystatin is also effective for candidiasis but it is ineffective against dermatophytosis. Refractory candidiasis requires systemic treatment generally with a triazole such as fluconazole; systemic treatment with terbinafine is not appropriate for refractory candidiasis.

Angular cheilitis

Miconazole cream is used in the fissures of angular cheilitis when associated with Candida.

Compound topical preparations

Combination of an imidazole and a mild corticosteroid (such as hydrocortisone 1%) may be of value in the treatment of eczematous intertrigo and, in the first few days only, of a severely inflamed patch of ringworm.

Combination of a mild corticosteroid with either an imidazole or nystatin may be of use in the treatment of intertrigo associated with candida.

Antiviral preparations

Aciclovir cream is licensed for the treatment of initial and recurrent labial and genital herpes simplex infections; treatment should begin as early as possible. Systemic treatment is necessary for buccal or vaginal infections and for herpes zoster (shingles).

Herpes labialis

Aciclovir cream can be used for the treatment of initial and recurrent labial herpes simplex infections (cold sores). It is best applied at the earliest possible stage, usually when prodromal changes of sensation are felt in the lip and before vesicles appear.

Penciclovir cream is also licensed for the treatment of herpes labialis; it needs to be applied more frequently than aciclovir cream.

Systemic treatment is necessary if cold sores recur frequently or for infections in the mouth.

Permethrin is used for the treatment of scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei); malathion can be used if permethrin is inappropriate.

Benzyl benzoate is an irritant and should be avoided in children; it is less effective than malathion and permethrin.

Ivermectin (available on a named patient basis from ‘special-order’ manufacturers or specialist importing companies) by mouth has been used, in combination with topical drugs, for the treatment of hyperkeratotic (crusted or ‘Norwegian’) scabies that does not respond to topical treatment alone; further doses may be required.

Application

Although acaricides have traditionally been applied after a hot bath, this is not necessary and there is even evidence that a hot bath may increase absorption into the blood, removing them from their site of action on the skin.

All members of the affected household should be treated simultaneously. Treatment should be applied to the whole body including the scalp, neck, face, and ears. Particular attention should be paid to the webs of the fingers and toes and lotion brushed under the ends of nails. It is now recommended that malathion and permethrin should be applied twice, one week apart; in the case of benzyl benzoate in adults, up to 3 applications on consecutive days may be needed. It is important to warn users to reapply treatment to the hands if they are washed. Patients with hyperkeratotic scabies may require 2 or 3 applications of acaricide on consecutive days to ensure that enough penetrates the skin crusts to kill all the mites.

Itching

The itch and eczema of scabies persists for some weeks after the infestation has been eliminated and treatment for pruritus and eczema may be required. Application of crotamiton can be used to control itching after treatment with more effective acaricides. A topical corticosteroid may help to reduce itch and inflammation after scabies has been treated successfully; however, persistent symptoms suggest that scabies eradication was not successful. Oral administration of a sedating antihistamine at night may also be useful.

Head lice

Dimeticone is effective against head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis). It coats head lice and interferes with water balance in lice by preventing the excretion of water; it is less active against eggs and treatment should be repeated after 7 days. Malathion, an organophosphorus insecticide, is an alternative, but resistance has been reported. Benzyl benzoate is licensed for the treatment of head lice but it is less effective than other drugs and not recommended for use in children. Permethrin is active against head lice but the formulation and licensed methods of application of the current products make them unsuitable for the treatment of head lice.

 Head lice infestation (pediculosis) should be treated using lotion or liquid formulations only if live lice are present. Shampoos are diluted too much in use to be effective. A contact time of 8–12 hours or overnight treatment is recommended for lotions and liquids; a 2-hour treatment is not sufficient to kill eggs.

In general, a course of treatment for head lice should be 2 applications of product 7 days apart to kill lice emerging from any eggs that survive the first application. All affected household members should be treated simultaneously.

Wet combing methods

Head lice can be mechanically removed by combing wet hair meticulously with a plastic detection comb (probably for at least 30 minutes each time) over the whole scalp at 4-day intervals for a minimum of 2 weeks, and continued until no lice are found on 3 consecutive sessions; hair conditioner or vegetable oil can be used to facilitate the process.

Several devices for the removal of head lice such as combs and topical solutions, are available and some are prescribable on the NHS.

Crab lice

Permethrin and malathion are used to eliminate crab lice (Pthirus pubis). An aqueous preparation should be applied, allowed to dry naturally and washed off after 12 hours; a second treatment is needed after 7 days to kill lice emerging from surviving eggs. All surfaces of the body should be treated, including the scalp, neck, and face (paying particular attention to the eyebrows and other facial hair). A different insecticide should be used if a course of treatment fails.

Local guidelines for the management of extravasation should be followed where they exist or specialist advice sought.

Extravasation injury follows leakage of drugs or intravenous fluids from the veins or inadvertent administration into the subcutaneous or subdermal tissue. It must be dealt with promptly to prevent tissue necrosis.

Acidic or alkaline preparations and those with an osmolarity greater than that of plasma can cause extravasation injury; excipients including alcohol and polyethylene glycol have also been implicated. Cytotoxic drugs commonly cause extravasation injury. In addition, certain patients such as the very young and the elderly are at increased risk. Those receiving anticoagulants are more likely to lose blood into surrounding tissues if extravasation occurs, while those receiving sedatives or analgesics may not notice the early signs or symptoms of extravasation.

Prevention of extravasation

Precautions should be taken to avoid extravasation; ideally, drugs likely to cause extravasation injury should be given through a central line and patients receiving repeated doses of hazardous drugs peripherally should have the cannula resited at regular intervals. Attention should be paid to the manufacturers’ recommendations for administration. Placing a glyceryl trinitrate patch distal to the cannula may improve the patency of the vessel in patients with small veins or in those whose veins are prone to collapse.

Patients should be asked to report any pain or burning at the site of injection immediately.

Management of extravasation

If extravasation is suspected the infusion should be stopped immediately but the cannula should not be removed until after an attempt has been made to aspirate the area (through the cannula) in order to remove as much of the drug as possible. Aspiration is sometimes possible if the extravasation presents with a raised bleb or blister at the injection site and is surrounded by hardened tissue, but it is often unsuccessful if the tissue is soft or soggy. Corticosteroids are usually given to treat inflammation, although there is little evidence to support their use in extravasation. Hydrocortisone or dexamethasone can be given either locally by subcutaneous injection or intravenously at a site distant from the injury. Antihistamines and analgesics may be required for symptom relief.

The management of extravasation beyond these measures is not well standardised and calls for specialist advice. Treatment depends on the nature of the offending substance; one approach is to localise and neutralise the substance whereas another is to spread and dilute it.

The first method may be appropriate following extravasation of vesicant drugs and involves administration of an antidote (if available) and the application of cold compresses 3–4 times a day (consult specialist literature for details of specific antidotes). Spreading and diluting the offending substance involves infiltrating the area with physiological saline, applying warm compresses, elevating the affected limb, and administering hyaluronidase. A saline flush-out technique (involving flushing the subcutaneous tissue with physiological saline) may be effective but requires specialist advice. Hyaluronidase should not be administered following extravasation of vesicant drugs (unless it is either specifically indicated or used in the saline flush-out technique). Dexrazoxane is licensed for the treatment of anthracycline-induced extravasation.

Enzymes

Collagenase

Collagenase are proteolytic enzymes that are derived from the fermentation of Clostridium histolyticum and have the ability to break down collagen. A preparation containing a mixture of two collagenases is licensed for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture; the preparation should be injected into a palpable cord with a contracture of a metacarpophalangeal joint or proximal interphalangeal joint.

Hyaluronidase

Hyaluronidase is used to render the tissues more readily permeable to injected fluids, e.g. for introduction of fluids by subcutaneous infusion (termed hypodermoclysis).

Rubefacients, topical NSAIDs, capsaicin, and poultices

Rubefacients act by counter-irritation. Pain, whether superficial or deep-seated, is relieved by any method that itself produces irritation of the skin. Topical rubefacient preparations may contain nicotinate and salicylate compounds, essential oils, capsicum, and camphor. The evidence available does not support the use of topical rubefacients in acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Topical NSAIDs

The use of a NSAID by mouth is effective for relieving musculoskeletal pain. Topical NSAIDs (e.g. felbinac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and piroxicam may provide some relief of pain in musculoskeletal conditions; they can be considered as an adjunctive treatment in knee or hand osteoarthritis.

Capsaicin

A preparation containing capsaicin 0.025% can be considered as an adjunct in hand or knee osteoarthritis.It may need to be used for 1–2 weeks before pain is relieved.

A capsaicin 0.075% cream is licensed for the symptomatic relief of postherpetic neuralgia after lesions have healed, and for the relief of painful diabetic neuropathy.

A self-adhesive patch containing capsaicin 8% is licensed for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic patients.

It is important to distinguish stable angina from unstable angina. Stable angina usually results from atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries that restrict blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart; it is often precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. Treatment involves management of acute anginal pain, and long term management to prevent angina attacks and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Management

Acute attacks of stable angina should be managed with sublingual glyceryl trinitrate which can be taken immediately before performing activities that are known to bring on an attack. If attacks occur more than twice a week, regular drug therapy is required and should be introduced in a step-wise manner according to response.

Patients with stable angina should be given a beta-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker. In those with left-ventricular dysfunction, beta-blocker treatment should be started at a very low dose and titrated very slowly over a period of weeks or months. If a beta-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker alone fails to control symptoms adequately, a combination of a beta-blocker and a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (e.g. amlodipine, felodipine, modified-release nifedipine) should be used; if this combination is not appropriate due to intolerance of, or contra-indication to, either beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers, addition of a long-acting nitrate, ivabradine, nicorandil, or ranolazine can be considered.

For those patients in whom both beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers are not tolerated or are contra- indicated, monotherapy with a long-acting nitrate, ivabradine, nicorandil, or ranolazine should be considered.

Response to treatment should be assessed every 2–4 weeks after initiating or changing drug therapy; the drug should be titrated (according to symptom control) to the maximum tolerated dose. Consider referring the patient to a specialist if a combination of two drugs fails to control symptoms. Addition of a third antianginal drug should only be considered if symptom control is not achieved with two drugs and the patient is either due to undergo a revascularisation procedure, or a revascularisation procedure is considered inappropriate. See the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing coronary stenting.

For long-term prevention of cardiovascular events, see Prevention of cardiovascular events.

Antianginal drugs

Nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, and potassium channel activators (use in adults only) have a vasodilating and, consequently, blood pressure lowering effect. Vasodilators can act in heart failure by arteriolar dilatation which reduces both peripheral vascular resistance and left ventricular pressure during systole resulting in improved cardiac output. They can also cause venous dilatation which results in dilatation of capacitance vessels, increase of venous pooling, and diminution of venous return to the heart (decreasing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure).

Nicorandil, a potassium-channel activator with a nitrate component, has both arterial and venous vasodilating properties and is licensed for the prevention and long-term treatment of angina. Nicorandil has similar efficacy to other antianginal drugs in controlling symptoms; it may produce additional symptomatic benefit in combination with other antianginal drugs [unlicensed indication].

Ivabradine lowers the heart rate by its action on the sinus node. It is licensed for the treatment of angina in patients who are in normal sinus rhythm in combination with a beta-blocker, or when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. Ivabradine, in combination with standard therapy including a beta-blocker (unless contra-indicated or not tolerated), is also licensed for mild to severe stable chronic heart failure in patients who are in sinus rhythm.

Ranolazine is licensed as adjunctive therapy in patients who are inadequately controlled or intolerant of first-line antianginal drugs.

    <p>Prescribing for patients with stoma calls for special care. The following is a brief account of some of the main points to be borne in mind.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Enteric-coated</i> and <i>modified-release</i> preparations are <b>unsuitable</b>, particularly in patients with an ileostomy, as there may not be sufficient release of the active ingredient.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Laxatives</p>
    <p>Enemas and washouts should <b>not</b> be prescribed for patients with an ileostomy as they may cause rapid and severe loss of water and electrolytes.</p>
    <p>Colostomy patients may suffer from constipation and whenever possible should be treated by increasing fluid intake or dietary fibre. <b>Bulk-forming drugs</b> should be tried. If they are insufficient, as small a dose as possible of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/senna.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP588\">senna</xref> should be used.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Antidiarrhoeals</p>
    <p>Drugs such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/loperamide-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP469\">loperamide hydrochloride</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/codeine-phosphate.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP460\">codeine phosphate</xref>, or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/co-phenotrope.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP464\">co-phenotrope</xref> (diphenoxylate with atropine) are effective. Bulk-forming drugs may be tried but it is often difficult to adjust the dose appropriately.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Antibacterials</b> should <b>not</b> be given for an episode of acute diarrhoea.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Antacids</p>
    <p>The tendency to diarrhoea from magnesium salts or constipation from aluminium salts may be increased in these patients.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Diuretics</p>
    <p>Diuretics should be used with caution in patients with an ileostomy as they may become excessively dehydrated and potassium depletion may easily occur. It is usually advisable to use a <b>potassium-sparing</b> diuretic.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Digoxin</p>
    <p>Patients with a stoma are particularly susceptible to hypokalaemia if on <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/digoxin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP752\">digoxin</xref> therapy and potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic may be advisable.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Potassium supplements</p>
    <p>Liquid formulations are preferred to modified-release formulations.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Analgesics</p>
    <p>Opioid analgesics may cause troublesome constipation in colostomy patients.

Prescribing for patients with stoma calls for special care. The following is a brief account of some of the main points to be borne in mind.

Enteric-coated and modified-release preparations are unsuitable, particularly in patients with an ileostomy, as there may not be sufficient release of the active ingredient.

Laxatives

Enemas and washouts should not be prescribed for patients with an ileostomy as they may cause rapid and severe loss of water and electrolytes.

Colostomy patients may suffer from constipation and whenever possible should be treated by increasing fluid intake or dietary fibre. Bulk-forming drugs should be tried. If they are insufficient, as small a dose as possible of senna should be used.

Antidiarrhoeals

Drugs such as loperamide hydrochloride, codeine phosphate, or co-phenotrope (diphenoxylate with atropine) are effective. Bulk-forming drugs may be tried but it is often difficult to adjust the dose appropriately.

Antibacterials should not be given for an episode of acute diarrhoea.

Antacids

The tendency to diarrhoea from magnesium salts or constipation from aluminium salts may be increased in these patients.

Diuretics

Diuretics should be used with caution in patients with an ileostomy as they may become excessively dehydrated and potassium depletion may easily occur. It is usually advisable to use a potassium-sparing diuretic.

Digoxin

Patients with a stoma are particularly susceptible to hypokalaemia if on digoxin therapy and potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic may be advisable.

Potassium supplements

Liquid formulations are preferred to modified-release formulations.

Analgesics

Opioid analgesics may cause troublesome constipation in colostomy patients. When a non-opioid analgesic is required paracetamol is usually suitable but anti-inflammatory analgesics may cause gastric irritation and bleeding.

Iron preparations

Iron preparations may cause loose stools and sore skin in these patients. If this is troublesome and if iron is definitely indicated an intramuscular iron preparation should be used. Modified-release preparations should be avoided for the reasons given above.

Care of stoma

Patients are usually given advice about the use of cleansing agents, protective creams, lotions, deodorants, or sealants whilst in hospital, either by the surgeon or by stoma care nurses. Voluntary organisations offer help and support to patients with stoma.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Alcohol dependence</p>
    <p>Excessive drinking of alcoholic beverages over a prolonged period of time can result in an alcohol withdrawal syndrome on abrupt cessation of, or marked reduction in, drinking. The presence and severity of alcohol dependence can be assessed by <i>The Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ)</i>; other assessment questionnaires are also available.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Acute alcohol withdrawal</p>
      <p>People with moderate dependence can generally be treated in a community setting unless they are under 18 years of age, or are at high-risk of severe reactions or treatment failure. People with severe dependence should undergo withdrawal in an inpatient setting; withdrawal in severely dependent patients without medical support may lead to seizures, delirium tremens, and death. Long-acting benzodiazepines, usually <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/chlordiazepoxide-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2167\">chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride</xref>, are used to attenuate alcohol withdrawal symptoms. In primary care, fixed-dose reducing regimens are usually used, whilst a symptom-triggered flexible regimen is used in hospital or other settings where continued assessment and monitoring is carried out for 24–48 hours, usually followed by a fixed 5-day reducing dose schedule (sometimes it may be necessary to continue treatment for up to 10 days). Patients with decompensated liver disease should be treated under specialist supervision.</p>
      <p>
        <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/carbamazepine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2909\">Carbamazepine</xref> [unlicensed indication] is sometimes used as an alternative treatment in acute alcohol withdrawal when benzodiazepines are contra-indicated or not tolerated. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/clomethiazole.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2138\">Clomethiazole</xref> is licensed for use in acute alcohol withdrawal, but benzodiazepines are preferred. It should only be used in an inpatient setting and should not be prescribed if the patient is liable to continue drinking alcohol.</p>
      <p>Patients with marked agitation or hallucinations and those at risk of delirium tremens (characterised by delirium, hallucinations, tremor, and disorientation) may be prescribed antipsychotic drugs, such as <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/haloperidol.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2226\">haloperidol</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/olanzapine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2277\">olanzapine</xref> [unlicensed indication], as adjunctive therapy to benzodiazepines; antipsychotics should not be used alone because they do not treat alcohol withdrawal and may lower the seizure threshold. Delirium tremens is a medical emergency that requires specialist inpatient care.</p>
      <p>If a patient taking a benzodiazepine as part of a withdrawal regimen develops alcohol withdrawal seizures, a fast-acting benzodiazepine (such as intravenous <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/lorazepam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2170\">lorazepam</xref> [unlicensed indication] or rectal <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/diazepam.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2159\">diazepam</xref>) should be prescribed; thereafter an increase in the dose of oral benzodiazepine should be considered to prevent further seizures from occurring.</p>

    <p>Smoking cessation interventions are a cost-effective way of reducing ill health and prolonging life. Smokers should be advised to stop and offered help with follow-up when appropriate. If possible, smokers should have access to smoking cessation services for behavioural support.</p>
    <p>Therapy to aid smoking cessation is chosen according to the smoker’s likely adherence, availability of counselling and support, previous experience of smoking-cessation aids, contra-indications and adverse effects of the preparations, and the smoker’s preferences. <b>Nicotine replacement therapy</b>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bupropion-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3190\">bupropion hydrochloride</xref>, and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/varenicline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3208\">varenicline</xref> are effective aids to smoking cessation. The use of nicotine replacement therapy in an individual who is already accustomed to nicotine introduces few new risks and it is widely accepted that there are no circumstances in which it is safer to smoke than to use nicotine replacement therapy.</p>
    <p>Some patients benefit from having more than one type of nicotine replacement therapy prescribed, such as a combination of transdermal and oral preparations. The combination of nicotine replacement therapy with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/varenicline.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3208\">varenicline</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/bupropion-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3190\">bupropion hydrochloride</xref> is not recommended.</p>

Oral preparations and<i> inhalation cartridges</i> can cause irritation of the throat, <i>gum</i>, <i>lozenges</i>, and <i>oral spray</i> can cause increased salivation, and <i>patches</i> can cause minor skin irritation. The <i>nasal spray</i> commonly causes coughing, nasal irritation, epistaxis, sneezing, and watery eyes; the <i>oral spray</i> can cause watery eyes and blurred vision.</p>
        <p>Gastro-intestinal disturbances are common and may be caused by swallowed nicotine. Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and hiccup occur most frequently. Ulcerative stomatitis has also been reported. Dry mouth is a common side-effect of <i>lozenges</i>, <i>patches</i>, <i>oral spray</i>, and <i>sublingual tablets</i>. <i>Lozenges</i> cause diarrhoea, constipation, dysphagia, oesophagitis, gastritis, mouth ulcers, bloating, flatulence, and less commonly, taste disturbance, thirst, gingival bleeding, and halitosis. The <i>oral spray</i> may also cause abdominal pain, flatulence, and taste disturbance.</p>
        <p>Palpitations may occur with nicotine replacement therapy and rarely <i>patches</i> and <i>oral spray</i> can cause arrhythmia. <i>Patches</i>, <i>lozenges</i>, and <i>oral spray</i> can cause chest pain. The <i>inhalator</i> can very rarely cause reversible atrial fibrillation.</p>

    <p>The management of opioid dependence requires medical, social, and psychological treatment; access to a multidisciplinary team is recommended. Treatment for opioid dependence should be initiated under the supervision of an appropriately qualified prescriber.</p>
    <p>Untreated heroin dependence shows early withdrawal symptoms within 8 hours, with peak symptoms at 36–72 hours; symptoms subside substantially after 5 days. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methadone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2065\">Methadone hydrochloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/buprenorphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2680\">buprenorphine</xref> withdrawal occurs later, with longer-lasting symptoms.</p>

Substitute medication should be commenced with a short period of stabilisation, followed by either a withdrawal regimen or by maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment enables patients to achieve stability, reduces drug use and crime, and improves health; it should be regularly reviewed to ensure the patient continues to derive benefit. The prescriber should monitor for signs of toxicity, and the patient should be told to be aware of warning signs of toxicity on initiation and during titration.</p>
      <p>A withdrawal regimen after stabilisation with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/methadone-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2065\">methadone hydrochloride</xref> or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/buprenorphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2680\">buprenorphine</xref> should be attempted only after careful consideration. Enforced withdrawal is ineffective for sustained abstinence, and it increases the risk of patients relapsing and subsequently overdosing because of loss of tolerance. Complete withdrawal from opioids usually takes up to 4 weeks in an inpatient or residential setting, and up to 12 weeks in a community setting. If abstinence is not achieved, illicit drug use is resumed, or the patient cannot tolerate withdrawal, the withdrawal regimen should be stopped and maintenance therapy should be resumed at the optimal dose. Following successful withdrawal treatment, further support and monitoring to maintain abstinence should be provided for a period of at least 6 months.</p>

        <p outputclass=\"title\">Missed doses</p>
        <p>Patients who miss 3 days or more of their regular prescribed dose of opioid maintenance therapy are at risk of overdose because of loss of tolerance. Consider reducing the dose in these patients.</p>
        <p>If the patient misses 5 or more days of treatment, an assessment of illicit drug use is also recommended before restarting substitution therapy; this is particularly important for patients taking <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/buprenorphine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP2680\">buprenorphine</xref> because of the risk of precipitated withdrawal.</p>

Because of the long half-life, plasma concentrations progressively rise during initial treatment even if the patient remains on the same daily dose (it takes 3–10 days for plasma concentrations to reach steady-state in patients on a stable dose); a dose tolerated on the first day of treatment may become a toxic dose on the third day as cumulative toxicity develops.

The UK health departments have produced guidance on the treatment of drug misuse in the UK. Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management (2007) is available at www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/clinical_guidelines_2007.pdf.

Alcohol dependence

Excessive drinking of alcoholic beverages over a prolonged period of time can result in an alcohol withdrawal syndrome on abrupt cessation of, or marked reduction in, drinking. The presence and severity of alcohol dependence can be assessed by The Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ); other assessment questionnaires are also available.

Acute alcohol withdrawal

People with moderate dependence can generally be treated in a community setting unless they are under 18 years of age, or are at high-risk of severe reactions or treatment failure. People with severe dependence should undergo withdrawal in an inpatient setting; withdrawal in severely dependent patients without medical support may lead to seizures, delirium tremens, and death. Long-acting benzodiazepines, usually chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, are used to attenuate alcohol withdrawal symptoms. In primary care, fixed-dose reducing regimens are usually used, whilst a symptom-triggered flexible regimen is used in hospital or other settings where continued assessment and monitoring is carried out for 24–48 hours, usually followed by a fixed 5-day reducing dose schedule (sometimes it may be necessary to continue treatment for up to 10 days). Patients with decompensated liver disease should be treated under specialist supervision.

Carbamazepine [unlicensed indication] is sometimes used as an alternative treatment in acute alcohol withdrawal when benzodiazepines are contra-indicated or not tolerated. Clomethiazole is licensed for use in acute alcohol withdrawal, but benzodiazepines are preferred. It should only be used in an inpatient setting and should not be prescribed if the patient is liable to continue drinking alcohol.

Patients with marked agitation or hallucinations and those at risk of delirium tremens (characterised by delirium, hallucinations, tremor, and disorientation) may be prescribed antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol or olanzapine [unlicensed indication], as adjunctive therapy to benzodiazepines; antipsychotics should not be used alone because they do not treat alcohol withdrawal and may lower the seizure threshold. Delirium tremens is a medical emergency that requires specialist inpatient care.

If a patient taking a benzodiazepine as part of a withdrawal regimen develops alcohol withdrawal seizures, a fast-acting benzodiazepine (such as intravenous lorazepam [unlicensed indication] or rectal diazepam) should be prescribed; thereafter an increase in the dose of oral benzodiazepine should be considered to prevent further seizures from occurring.

Alcohol dependence

Acamprosate calcium and naltrexone hydrochloride are effective treatments for relapse prevention in patients with alcohol dependence; disulfiram is an alternative. Disulfiram should only be used in patients in whom acamprosate calcium and naltrexone hydrochloride are not suitable, or if the patient prefers disulfiram. Nalmefene is licensed for the reduction of alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence who have a high drinking risk level, without physical withdrawal symptoms, and who do not require immediate detoxification.

Patients with alcohol dependence are at risk of developing Wernicke’s encephalopathy; patients at high-risk are those who are malnourished, at risk of malnourishment, or have decompensated liver disease. Parenteral thiamine (as Pabrinex) should be prescribed for treatment of suspected or confirmed Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and for prophylaxis in alcohol dependent patients attending hospital for acute treatment (including treatment unrelated to alcohol dependence); parenteral prophylaxis may also be considered for high-risk patients being treated in primary care. High-dose oral thiamine should be prescribed following parenteral treatment until cognitive function is maximised. In primary care, prophylactic high-dose oral thiamine should be prescribed during acute withdrawal of alcohol, before planned withdrawal, and for patients not undergoing withdrawal but who are at high-risk of developing Wernicke’s encephalopathy.

Patients with chronic alcohol-related pancreatitis who have symptoms of steatorrhoea or who have poor nutritional status due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should be prescribed pancreatic enzyme supplements; supplements are not indicated when pain is the only symptom.

Corticosteroids are used in patients with severe acute alcohol-related hepatitis.

Drugs used in alcohol dependence

Acamprosate

Acamprosate calcium, in combination with counselling, may be helpful for maintaining abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients. It is useful for patients who are concerned that strong cravings will result in relapse. It should be initiated as soon as possible after abstinence has been achieved and continued for 1 year; treatment should be maintained if the patient has a temporary relapse but stopped if the patient returns to regular or excessive drinking that persists 4–6 weeks after starting treatment. Acamprosate calcium is not effective in all patients, so efficacy should be regularly assessed.

Disulfiram

Disulfiram gives rise to an extremely unpleasant systemic reaction after the ingestion of even a small amount of alcohol because it causes accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body; it is only effective if taken daily. Symptoms can occur within 10 minutes of ingesting alcohol and include flushing of the face, throbbing headache, palpitation, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and, with large doses of alcohol, arrhythmias, hypotension, and collapse; these reactions can last several hours. Small amounts of alcohol such as those included in many oral medicines may be sufficient to precipitate a reaction—even toiletries and mouthwashes that contain alcohol should be avoided.

Nalmefene

Nalmefene should only be prescribed in conjunction with continuous psychosocial support focused on treatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption. Nalmefene is not recommended for patients aiming to achieve immediate abstinence.

Naltrexone

Naltrexone hydrochloride is an opioid-receptor antagonist, but is useful as an adjunct in the treatment of alcohol dependence after a successful withdrawal. Treatment should be initiated by a specialist and continued under specialist supervision. Naltrexone hydrochloride should be stopped if drinking continues for 4–6 weeks after starting treatment.

Nicotine dependence

Smoking cessation interventions are a cost-effective way of reducing ill health and prolonging life. Smokers should be advised to stop and offered help with follow-up when appropriate. If possible, smokers should have access to smoking cessation services for behavioural support.

Therapy to aid smoking cessation is chosen according to the smoker’s likely adherence, availability of counselling and support, previous experience of smoking-cessation aids, contra-indications and adverse effects of the preparations, and the smoker’s preferences. Nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion hydrochloride, and varenicline are effective aids to smoking cessation. The use of nicotine replacement therapy in an individual who is already accustomed to nicotine introduces few new risks and it is widely accepted that there are no circumstances in which it is safer to smoke than to use nicotine replacement therapy.

Some patients benefit from having more than one type of nicotine replacement therapy prescribed, such as a combination of transdermal and oral preparations. The combination of nicotine replacement therapy with varenicline or bupropion hydrochloride is not recommended.

Concomitant medication

Cigarette smoking increases the metabolism of some medicines by stimulating the hepatic enzyme CYP1A2. When smoking is discontinued, the dose of these drugs, in particular theophylline, cinacalcet, ropinirole, and some antipsychotics (including clozapine, olanzapine, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, and haloperidol, may need to be reduced. Regular monitoring for adverse effects is advised.

Bupropion hydrochloride has been used as an antidepressant. Its mode of action in smoking cessation is not clear and may involve an effect on noradrenaline and dopamine neurotransmission.

Nicotine replacement therapy

Nicotine replacement therapy can be used in place of cigarettes after abrupt cessation of smoking, or alternatively to reduce the amount of cigarettes used in advance of making a quit attempt. Nicotine replacement therapy can also be used to minimise passive smoking, and to treat cravings and reduce compensatory smoking after enforced abstinence in smoke-free environments. Smokers who find it difficult to achieve abstinence should consult a healthcare professional for advice.

Choice

Nicotine patches are a prolonged-release formulation and are applied for 16 hours (with the patch removed overnight) or for 24 hours. If patients experience strong cravings for cigarettes on waking, a 24-hour patch may be more suitable. Immediate-release nicotine preparations (gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhalator, nasal spray, and oral spray) are used whenever the urge to smoke occurs or to prevent cravings.

The choice of nicotine replacement preparation depends largely on patient preference, and should take into account what preparations, if any, have been tried before. Patients with a high level of nicotine dependence, or who have failed with nicotine replacement therapy previously, may benefit from using a combination of an immediate-release preparation and patches to achieve abstinence.

Side-effects of specific nicotine preparations

Mild local reactions at the beginning of treatment are common because of the irritant effect of nicotine. Oral preparations and inhalation cartridges can cause irritation of the throat, gum, lozenges, and oral spray can cause increased salivation, and patches can cause minor skin irritation. The nasal spray commonly causes coughing, nasal irritation, epistaxis, sneezing, and watery eyes; the oral spray can cause watery eyes and blurred vision.

Gastro-intestinal disturbances are common and may be caused by swallowed nicotine. Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and hiccup occur most frequently. Ulcerative stomatitis has also been reported. Dry mouth is a common side-effect of lozenges, patches, oral spray, and sublingual tablets. Lozenges cause diarrhoea, constipation, dysphagia, oesophagitis, gastritis, mouth ulcers, bloating, flatulence, and less commonly, taste disturbance, thirst, gingival bleeding, and halitosis. The oral spray may also cause abdominal pain, flatulence, and taste disturbance.

Palpitations may occur with nicotine replacement therapy and rarely patches and oral spray can cause arrhythmia. Patches, lozenges, and oral spray can cause chest pain. The inhalator can very rarely cause reversible atrial fibrillation.

Paraesthesia is a common side-effect of oral spray. Abnormal dreams can occur with patches; removal of the patch before bed may help. Lozenges and oral spray may cause rash and hot flushes. Sweating and myalgia can occur with patches and oral spray; the patches can also cause arthralgia.

Opioid dependence

The management of opioid dependence requires medical, social, and psychological treatment; access to a multidisciplinary team is recommended. Treatment for opioid dependence should be initiated under the supervision of an appropriately qualified prescriber.

Untreated heroin dependence shows early withdrawal symptoms within 8 hours, with peak symptoms at 36–72 hours; symptoms subside substantially after 5 days. Methadone hydrochloride or buprenorphine withdrawal occurs later, with longer-lasting symptoms.

Opioid substitution therapy

Methadone hydrochloride and buprenorphine are used as substitution therapy in opioid dependence. Substitute medication should be commenced with a short period of stabilisation, followed by either a withdrawal regimen or by maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment enables patients to achieve stability, reduces drug use and crime, and improves health; it should be regularly reviewed to ensure the patient continues to derive benefit. The prescriber should monitor for signs of toxicity, and the patient should be told to be aware of warning signs of toxicity on initiation and during titration.

A withdrawal regimen after stabilisation with methadone hydrochloride or buprenorphine should be attempted only after careful consideration. Enforced withdrawal is ineffective for sustained abstinence, and it increases the risk of patients relapsing and subsequently overdosing because of loss of tolerance. Complete withdrawal from opioids usually takes up to 4 weeks in an inpatient or residential setting, and up to 12 weeks in a community setting. If abstinence is not achieved, illicit drug use is resumed, or the patient cannot tolerate withdrawal, the withdrawal regimen should be stopped and maintenance therapy should be resumed at the optimal dose. Following successful withdrawal treatment, further support and monitoring to maintain abstinence should be provided for a period of at least 6 months.

Missed doses

Patients who miss 3 days or more of their regular prescribed dose of opioid maintenance therapy are at risk of overdose because of loss of tolerance. Consider reducing the dose in these patients.

If the patient misses 5 or more days of treatment, an assessment of illicit drug use is also recommended before restarting substitution therapy; this is particularly important for patients taking buprenorphine because of the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Buprenorphine

Buprenorphine is preferred by some patients because it is less sedating than methadone hydrochloride; for this reason it may be more suitable for employed patients or those undertaking other skilled tasks such as driving. Buprenorphine is safer than methadone hydrochloride when used in conjunction with other sedating drugs, and has fewer drug interactions. Dose reductions may be easier than with methadone hydrochloride because the withdrawal symptoms are milder, and patients generally require fewer adjunctive medications; there is also a lower risk of overdose. Buprenorphine can be given on alternate days in higher doses and it requires a shorter drug-free period than methadone hydrochloride before induction with naltrexone hydrochloride for prevention of relapse.

Patients dependent on high doses of opioids may be at increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Precipitated withdrawal can occur in any patient if buprenorphine is administered when other opioid agonist drugs are in circulation. Precipitated opioid withdrawal, if it occurs, starts within 1–3 hours of the first buprenorphine dose and peaks at around 6 hours. Non-opioid adjunctive therapy, such as lofexidine hydrochloride, may be required if symptoms are severe.

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal, the first dose of buprenorphine should be given when the patient is exhibiting signs of withdrawal, or 6–12 hours after the last use of heroin (or other short-acting opioid), or 24–48 hours after the last dose of methadone hydrochloride. It is possible to titrate the dose of buprenorphine within one week—more rapidly than with methadone hydrochloride therapy—but care is still needed to avoid toxicity or precipitated withdrawal; dividing the dose on the first day may be useful.

A combination preparation containing buprenorphine with naloxone (Suboxone) can be prescribed for patients when there is a risk of dose diversion for parenteral administration; the naloxone hydrochloride component precipitates withdrawal if the preparation is injected, but it has little effect when the preparation is taken sublingually.

 Methadone

Methadone hydrochloride, a long-acting opioid agonist, is usually administered in a single daily dose as methadone hydrochloride oral solution 1 mg/mL. Patients with a long history of opioid misuse, those who typically abuse a variety of sedative drugs and alcohol, and those who experience increased anxiety during withdrawal of opioids may prefer methadone hydrochloride to buprenorphine because it has a more pronounced sedative effect.

Methadone hydrochloride is initiated at least 8 hours after the last heroin dose, provided that there is objective evidence of withdrawal symptoms. A supplementary dose on the first day may be considered if there is evidence of persistent opioid withdrawal symptoms. Because of the long half-life, plasma concentrations progressively rise during initial treatment even if the patient remains on the same daily dose (it takes 3–10 days for plasma concentrations to reach steady-state in patients on a stable dose); a dose tolerated on the first day of treatment may become a toxic dose on the third day as cumulative toxicity develops. Thus, titration to the optimal dose in methadone hydrochloride maintenance treatment may take several weeks.

Opioid substitution during pregnancy

Acute withdrawal of opioids should be avoided in pregnancy because it can cause fetal death. Opioid substitution therapy is recommended during pregnancy because it carries a lower risk to the fetus than continued use of illicit drugs. If a woman who is stabilised on methadone hydrochloride or buprenorphine for treatment of opioid dependence becomes pregnant, therapy should be continued [buprenorphine is not licensed for use in pregnancy]. Many pregnant patients choose a withdrawal regimen, but withdrawal during the first trimester should be avoided because it is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage. Withdrawal of methadone hydrochloride or buprenorphine should be undertaken gradually during the second trimester, with dose reductions made every 3–5 days. If illicit drug use occurs, the patient should be re-stabilised at the optimal maintenance dose and consideration should be given to stopping the withdrawal regimen.

Further withdrawal of methadone hydrochloride or buprenorphine in the third trimester is not recommended because maternal withdrawal, even if mild, is associated with fetal distress, stillbirth, and the risk of neonatal mortality. Drug metabolism can be increased in the third trimester; it may be necessary to either increase the dose of methadone hydrochloride or change to twice-daily consumption (or a combination of both strategies) to prevent withdrawal symptoms from developing.

The neonate should be monitored for respiratory depression and signs of withdrawal if the mother is prescribed high doses of opioid substitute.

Signs of neonatal withdrawal from opioids usually develop 24–72 hours after delivery but symptoms may be delayed for up to 14 days, so monitoring may be required for several weeks. Symptoms include a high-pitched cry, rapid breathing, hungry but ineffective suckling, and excessive wakefulness; severe, but rare symptoms include hypertonicity and convulsions.

Opioid substitution during breastfeeding

Doses of methadone and buprenorphine should be kept as low as possible in breast-feeding mothers. Increased sleepiness, breathing difficulties, or limpness in breast-fed babies of mothers taking opioid substitutes should be reported urgently to a healthcare professional.

Adjunctive therapy and symptomatic treatment

Adjunctive therapy may be required for the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Loperamide hydrochloride may be used for the control of diarrhoea; mebeverine hydrochloride for controlling stomach cramps; paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for muscular pains and headaches; metoclopramide hydrochloride or prochlorperazine may be useful for nausea or vomiting. Topical rubefacients can be helpful for relieving muscle pain associated with methadone hydrochloride withdrawal. If a patient is suffering from insomnia, short-acting benzodiazepines or zopiclone may be prescribed, but because of the potential for abuse, prescriptions should be limited to a short course of a few days only. If anxiety or agitation is severe, specialist advice should be sought.

Lofexidine

Lofexidine hydrochloride may alleviate some of the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal by attenuating the increase in adrenergic neurotransmission that occurs during opioid withdrawal. Lofexidine hydrochloride can be prescribed as an adjuvant to opioid substitution therapy, initiated either at the same time as the opioid substitute or during withdrawal of the opioid substitute. Alternatively, lofexidine hydrochloride may be prescribed instead of an opioid substitute in patients who have mild or uncertain dependence (including young people), and those with a short history of illicit drug use.

Opioid-receptor antagonists

Patients dependant on opioids can be given a supply of naloxone hydrochloride to be used in case of accidental overdose.

Naltrexone hydrochloride precipitates withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent subjects. Because the effects of opioid-receptor agonists are blocked by naltrexone hydrochloride, it is prescribed as an aid to prevent relapse in formerly opioid-dependent patients.

    <p>The risk of losing disease control on stopping long-term medication before surgery is often greater than the risk posed by continuing it during surgery. It is vital that the anaesthetist knows about <b>all</b> drugs that a patient is (or has been) taking.</p>
    <p>Patients with adrenal atrophy resulting from long-term corticosteroid use may suffer a precipitous fall in blood pressure unless corticosteroid cover is provided during anaesthesia and in the immediate postoperative period.

The risk of losing disease control on stopping long-term medication before surgery is often greater than the risk posed by continuing it during surgery. It is vital that the anaesthetist knows about all drugs that a patient is (or has been) taking.

Patients with adrenal atrophy resulting from long-term corticosteroid use may suffer a precipitous fall in blood pressure unless corticosteroid cover is provided during anaesthesia and in the immediate postoperative period. Anaesthetists must therefore know whether a patient is, or has been, receiving corticosteroids (including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids).

Other drugs that should normally not be stopped before surgery include antiepileptics, antiparkinsonian drugs, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, bronchodilators, cardiovascular drugs (but see potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists), glaucoma drugs, immunosuppressants, drugs of dependence, and thyroid or antithyroid drugs. Expert advice is required for patients receiving antivirals for HIV infection. See general advice on surgery in diabetic patients in Insulins and anti-diabetic drugs, Diabetes and surgery.

Patients taking antiplatelet medication or an oral anticoagulant present an increased risk for surgery. In these circumstances, the anaesthetist and surgeon should assess the relative risks and decide jointly whether the antiplatelet or the anticoagulant drug should be stopped or replaced with heparin (unfractionated) or low molecular weight heparin therapy.

Drugs that should be stopped before surgery include combined oral contraceptives, see Contraceptives, hormonal; for advice on hormone replacement therapy, see Sex hormones. MAOIs can have important interactions with some drugs used during surgery, such as pethidine hydrochloride. Tricyclic antidepressants need not be stopped, but there may be an increased risk of arrhythmias and hypotension (and dangerous interactions with vasopressor drugs); therefore, the anaesthetist should be informed if they are not stopped. Lithium should be stopped 24 hours before major surgery but the normal dose can be continued for minor surgery (with careful monitoring of fluids and electrolytes). Potassium-sparing diuretics may need to be withheld on the morning of surgery because hyperkalaemia may develop if renal perfusion is impaired or if there is tissue damage.

Shock

Shock is a medical emergency associated with a high mortality. The underlying causes of shock such as haemorrhage, sepsis, or myocardial insufficiency should be corrected. The profound hypotension of shock must be treated promptly to prevent tissue hypoxia and organ failure. Volume replacement is essential to correct the hypovolaemia associated with haemorrhage and sepsis but may be detrimental in cardiogenic shock. Depending on haemodynamic status, cardiac output may be improved by the use of sympathomimetic inotropes such as adrenaline/epinephrine, dobutamine or dopamine hydrochloride. In septic shock, when fluid replacement and inotropic support fail to maintain blood pressure, the vasoconstrictor noradrenaline/norepinephrine may be considered. In cardiogenic shock peripheral resistance is frequently high and to raise it further may worsen myocardial performance and exacerbate tissue ischaemia.

The use of sympathomimetic inotropes and vasoconstrictors should preferably be confined to the intensive care setting and undertaken with invasive haemodynamic monitoring.

See also advice on the management of anaphylactic shock in Antihistamines, allergen immunotherapy and allergic emergencies.

Vasoconstrictor sympathomimetics

Vasoconstrictor sympathomimetics raise blood pressure transiently by acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors to constrict peripheral vessels. They are sometimes used as an emergency method of elevating blood pressure where other measures have failed. 

The danger of vasoconstrictors is that although they raise blood pressure they also reduce perfusion of vital organs such as the kidney.

Spinal and epidural anaesthesia may result in sympathetic block with resultant hypotension. Management may include intravenous fluids (which are usually given prophylactically), oxygen, elevation of the legs, and injection of a pressor drug such as ephedrine hydrochloride. As well as constricting peripheral vessels ephedrine hydrochloride also accelerates the heart rate (by acting on beta receptors). Use is made of this dual action of ephedrine hydrochloride to manage associated bradycardia (although intravenous injection of atropine sulfate may also be required if bradycardia persists).

Topical corticosteroids are used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the skin (other than those arising from an infection), in particular eczema, contact dermatitis, insect stings, and eczema of scabies. Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory reaction during use; they are not curative and on discontinuation a rebound exacerbation of the condition may occur. They are generally used to relieve symptoms and suppress signs of the disorder when other measures such as emollients are ineffective.

Topical corticosteroids are not recommended in the routine treatment of urticaria; treatment should only be initiated and supervised by a specialist. They should not be used indiscriminately in pruritus (where they will only benefit if inflammation is causing the itch) and are not recommended for acne vulgaris.

Systemic or very potent topical corticosteroids should be avoided or given only under specialist supervision in psoriasis because, although they may suppress the psoriasis in the short term, relapse or vigorous rebound occurs on withdrawal (sometimes precipitating severe pustular psoriasis). See the role of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of psoriasis.

In general, the most potent topical corticosteroids should be reserved for recalcitrant dermatoses such as chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen simplex chronicus, hypertrophic lichen planus, and palmoplantar pustulosis. Potent corticosteroids should generally be avoided on the face and skin flexures, but specialists occasionally prescribe them for use on these areas in certain circumstances.

When topical treatment has failed, intralesional corticosteroid injections may be used. These are more effective than the very potent topical corticosteroid preparations and should be reserved for severe cases where there are localised lesions such as keloid scars, hypertrophic lichen planus, or localised alopecia areata.

Perioral lesions

Hydrocortisone cream 1% can be used for up to 7 days to treat uninfected inflammatory lesions on the lips. Hydrocortisone with miconazole cream or ointment is useful where infection by susceptible organisms and inflammation co-exist, particularly for initial treatment (up to 7 days) e.g. in angular cheilitis. Organisms susceptible to miconazole include Candida spp. and many Gram-positive bacteria including streptococci and staphylococci.

Choice of formulation

Water-miscible corticosteroid creams are suitable for moist or weeping lesions whereas ointments are generally chosen for dry, lichenified or scaly lesions or where a more occlusive effect is required. Lotions may be useful when minimal application to a large or hair-bearing area is required or for the treatment of exudative lesions. Occlusive polythene or hydrocolloid dressings increase absorption, but also increase the risk of side effects; they are therefore used only under supervision on a short-term basis for areas of very thick skin (such as the palms and soles). The inclusion of urea or salicylic acid also increases the penetration of the corticosteroid.

In the BNF publications topical corticosteroids for the skin are categorised as ‘mild’, ‘moderately potent’, ‘potent’ or ‘very potent’; the least potent preparation which is effective should be chosen but dilution should be avoided whenever possible.

Absorption through the skin

Mild and moderately potent topical corticosteroids are associated with few side-effects but care is required in the use of potent  and very potent corticosteroids. Absorption through the skin can rarely cause adrenal suppression and even Cushing’s syndrome, depending on the area of the body being treated and the duration of treatment. Absorption is greatest where the skin is thin or raw, and from intertriginous areas; it is increased by occlusion.

Suitable quantities of corticosteroid preparations to be prescribed for specific areas of the bodyArea of bodyCreams and OintmentsFace and neck15 to 30 gBoth hands15 to 30 gScalp15 to 30 gBoth arms30 to 60gBoth legs100 gTrunk100 gGroins and genitalia15 to 30 gThese amounts are usually suitable for an adult for a single daily application for 2 weeks Compound preparations

The advantages of including other substances (such as antibacterials or antifungals) with corticosteroids in topical preparations are uncertain, but such combinations may have a place where inflammatory skin conditions are associated with bacterial or fungal infection, such as infected eczema. In these cases the antimicrobial drug should be chosen according to the sensitivity of the infecting organism and used regularly for a short period (typically twice daily for 1 week). Longer use increases the likelihood of resistance and of sensitisation.

The keratolytic effect of salicylic acid facilitates the absorption of topical corticosteroids; however, excessive and prolonged use of topical preparations containing salicylic acid may cause salicylism.

There is no requirement for cholera vaccination as a condition for entry into any country, but oral cholera vaccine should be considered for backpackers and those travelling to situations where the risk is greatest (e.g. refugee camps). Regardless of vaccination, travellers to areas where cholera is endemic should take special care with food hygiene.

Advice on diphtheria, on Japanese encephalitis, and on tick-borne encephalitis is included in Health Information for Overseas Travel.

Food hygiene

In areas where sanitation is poor, good food hygiene is important to help prevent hepatitis A, typhoid, cholera, and other diarrhoeal diseases (including travellers’ diarrhoea). Food should be freshly prepared and hot, and uncooked vegetables (including green salads) should be avoided; only fruits which can be peeled should be eaten. Only suitable bottled water, or tap water that has been boiled or treated with sterilising tablets, should be used for drinking.

  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Treatment phases, overview</p>
    <p>Tuberculosis is treated in two phases—an <i>initial phase</i> using 4 drugs and a <i>continuation phase</i> using 2 drugs in fully sensitive cases. Treatment requires specialised knowledge and supervision, particularly where the disease involves resistant organisms or non-respiratory organs.</p>
    <p>There are two regimens recommended for the treatment of tuberculosis in the UK; variations occur in other countries. Either the unsupervised regimen or the supervised regimen should be used; the two regimens should <b>not</b> be used concurrently. Compliance with therapy is a major determinant of its success.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Initial phase</p>
    <p>The concurrent use of 4 drugs during the initial phase is designed to reduce the bacterial population as rapidly as possible and to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. The drugs are best given as combination preparations unless one of the components cannot be given because of resistance or intolerance. The treatment of choice for the initial phase is the daily use of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">rifampicin</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pyrazinamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3612\">pyrazinamide</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ethambutol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3604\">ethambutol hydrochloride</xref>. Treatment should be started without waiting for culture results if clinical features or histology results are consistent with tuberculosis; treatment should be continued even if initial culture results are negative. The initial phase drugs should be continued for 2 months. Where a positive culture for <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>M. tuberculosis</i></ph> has been obtained, but susceptibility results are not available after 2 months, treatment with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">rifampicin</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pyrazinamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3612\">pyrazinamide</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ethambutol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3604\">ethambutol hydrochloride</xref> should be continued until full susceptibility is confirmed, even if this is for longer than 2 months.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/streptomycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3636\">Streptomycin</xref> is rarely used in the UK but it may be used in the initial phase of treatment if resistance to <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref> has been established before therapy is commenced.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Continuation phase</p>
    <p>After the initial phase, treatment is continued for a further 4 months with <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin-with-isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP85622\">rifampicin with isoniazid</xref> (preferably given as a combination preparation). Longer treatment is necessary for meningitis, direct spinal cord involvement, and for resistant organisms which may also require modification of the regimen.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Unsupervised treatment</p>
    <p>The unsupervised treatment regimen should be used for patients who are likely to take antituberculous drugs reliably <b>without supervision</b>. Patients who are unlikely to comply with daily administration of antituberculous drugs should be treated with the regimen described under Supervised Treatment.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
      <p>The standard unsupervised 6-month treatment regimen may be used during pregnancy. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/streptomycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3636\">Streptomycin</xref> should not be given in pregnancy.</p>
      <p>The standard unsupervised 6-month treatment regimen may be used during breast-feeding.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Supervised treatment</p>
    <p>Drug administration needs to be <b>fully supervised</b> (directly observed therapy, DOT) in patients who cannot comply reliably with the treatment regimen. These patients are given <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">rifampicin</xref>, <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pyrazinamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3612\">pyrazinamide</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ethambutol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3604\">ethambutol hydrochloride</xref> (or <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/streptomycin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3636\">streptomycin</xref>) 3 times a week under supervision for the first 2 months followed by <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">rifampicin</xref> 3 times a week for a further 4 months.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Immunocompromised patients</p>
    <p>Multi-resistant <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i></ph> may be present in immunocompromised patients. The organism should always be cultured to confirm its type and drug sensitivity. Confirmed <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>M. tuberculosis</i></ph> infection sensitive to first-line drugs should be treated with a standard 6-month regimen; after completing treatment, patients should be closely monitored. The regimen may need to be modified if infection is caused by resistant organisms, and specialist advice is needed.</p>
    <p>Specialist advice should be sought about tuberculosis treatment or chemoprophylaxis in a HIV-positive individual; care is required in choosing the regimen and in avoiding potentially serious interactions. Starting antiretroviral treatment in the first 2 months of antituberculosis treatment increases the risk of immune reconstitution syndrome.</p>
    <p>Infection may also be caused by other mycobacteria e.g. <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>M. avium</i></ph> complex in which case specialist advice on management is needed.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Corticosteroids</p>
    <p>In meningeal or pericardial tuberculosis, a corticosteroid should be started at the same time as antituberculosis therapy.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Prevention of tuberculosis</p>
    <p>Some individuals may develop tuberculosis owing to reactivation of previously latent disease. Chemoprophylaxis may be required in those who have evidence of latent tuberculosis and are receiving treatment with immunosuppressants (including cytotoxics and possibly long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids). In these cases, chemoprophylaxis involves use of either <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref> alone for 6 months or of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref> and <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">rifampicin</xref> for 3 months; longer chemoprophylaxis is not recommended.</p>
    <p>See prevention of tuberculosis in susceptible close contacts or those who have become tuberculin-positive. See advice on immunisation against tuberculosis.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Treatment failure</p>
    <p>Major causes of treatment failure are incorrect prescribing by the physician and inadequate compliance by the patient. Monthly tablet counts and urine examination (rifampicin imparts an orange-red coloration) may be useful indicators of compliance with treatment. Avoid both excessive and inadequate dosage. Treatment should be supervised by a specialist physician.</p>
  </sectiondiv>
  <sectiondiv>
    <p outputclass=\"title\">Antituberculosis drugs</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">Isoniazid</xref> is cheap and highly effective. Like <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">rifampicin</xref> it should always be included in any antituberculous regimen unless there is a specific contra-indication.</p>
    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">Rifampicin</xref>, a rifamycin, is a key component of any antituberculous regimen. Like <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/isoniazid.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3608\">isoniazid</xref> it should always be included unless there is a specific contra-indication.</p>
    <p>During the first two months (‘initial phase’) of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rifampicin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3619\">rifampicin</xref> administration transient disturbance of liver function with elevated serum transaminases is common but generally does not require interruption of treatment. Occasionally more serious liver toxicity requires a change of treatment particularly in those with pre-existing liver disease.</p>
    <p>On intermittent treatment six toxicity syndromes have been recognised—influenza-like, abdominal, and respiratory symptoms, shock, renal failure, and thrombocytopenic purpura—and can occur in 20 to 30% of patients.</p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/pyrazinamide.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3612\">Pyrazinamide</xref> is a bactericidal drug only active against intracellular dividing forms of <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i></ph>; it exerts its main effect only in the first two or three months.

    <p>
      <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/ethambutol-hydrochloride.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP3604\">Ethambutol hydrochloride</xref> is included in a treatment regimen if isoniazid resistance is suspected; it can be omitted if the risk of resistance is low.</p>

Tuberculosis is treated in two phases—an initial phase using 4 drugs and a continuation phase using 2 drugs in fully sensitive cases. Treatment requires specialised knowledge and supervision, particularly where the disease involves resistant organisms or non-respiratory organs.

There are two regimens recommended for the treatment of tuberculosis in the UK; variations occur in other countries. Either the unsupervised regimen or the supervised regimen should be used; the two regimens should not be used concurrently. Compliance with therapy is a major determinant of its success.

Initial phase

The concurrent use of 4 drugs during the initial phase is designed to reduce the bacterial population as rapidly as possible and to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. The drugs are best given as combination preparations unless one of the components cannot be given because of resistance or intolerance. The treatment of choice for the initial phase is the daily use of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol hydrochloride. Treatment should be started without waiting for culture results if clinical features or histology results are consistent with tuberculosis; treatment should be continued even if initial culture results are negative. The initial phase drugs should be continued for 2 months. Where a positive culture for M. tuberculosis has been obtained, but susceptibility results are not available after 2 months, treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol hydrochloride should be continued until full susceptibility is confirmed, even if this is for longer than 2 months.

Streptomycin is rarely used in the UK but it may be used in the initial phase of treatment if resistance to isoniazid has been established before therapy is commenced.

Continuation phase

After the initial phase, treatment is continued for a further 4 months with rifampicin with isoniazid (preferably given as a combination preparation). Longer treatment is necessary for meningitis, direct spinal cord involvement, and for resistant organisms which may also require modification of the regimen.

Unsupervised treatment

The unsupervised treatment regimen should be used for patients who are likely to take antituberculous drugs reliably without supervision. Patients who are unlikely to comply with daily administration of antituberculous drugs should be treated with the regimen described under Supervised Treatment.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding

The standard unsupervised 6-month treatment regimen may be used during pregnancy. Streptomycin should not be given in pregnancy.

The standard unsupervised 6-month treatment regimen may be used during breast-feeding.

Supervised treatment

Drug administration needs to be fully supervised (directly observed therapy, DOT) in patients who cannot comply reliably with the treatment regimen. These patients are given isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol hydrochloride (or streptomycin) 3 times a week under supervision for the first 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin 3 times a week for a further 4 months.

Immunocompromised patients

Multi-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be present in immunocompromised patients. The organism should always be cultured to confirm its type and drug sensitivity. Confirmed M. tuberculosis infection sensitive to first-line drugs should be treated with a standard 6-month regimen; after completing treatment, patients should be closely monitored. The regimen may need to be modified if infection is caused by resistant organisms, and specialist advice is needed.

Specialist advice should be sought about tuberculosis treatment or chemoprophylaxis in a HIV-positive individual; care is required in choosing the regimen and in avoiding potentially serious interactions. Starting antiretroviral treatment in the first 2 months of antituberculosis treatment increases the risk of immune reconstitution syndrome.

Infection may also be caused by other mycobacteria e.g. M. avium complex in which case specialist advice on management is needed.

Corticosteroids

In meningeal or pericardial tuberculosis, a corticosteroid should be started at the same time as antituberculosis therapy.

Prevention of tuberculosis

Some individuals may develop tuberculosis owing to reactivation of previously latent disease. Chemoprophylaxis may be required in those who have evidence of latent tuberculosis and are receiving treatment with immunosuppressants (including cytotoxics and possibly long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids). In these cases, chemoprophylaxis involves use of either isoniazid alone for 6 months or of isoniazid and rifampicin for 3 months; longer chemoprophylaxis is not recommended.

See prevention of tuberculosis in susceptible close contacts or those who have become tuberculin-positive. See advice on immunisation against tuberculosis.

Treatment failure

Major causes of treatment failure are incorrect prescribing by the physician and inadequate compliance by the patient. Monthly tablet counts and urine examination (rifampicin imparts an orange-red coloration) may be useful indicators of compliance with treatment. Avoid both excessive and inadequate dosage. Treatment should be supervised by a specialist physician.

Antituberculosis drugs

Isoniazid is cheap and highly effective. Like rifampicin it should always be included in any antituberculous regimen unless there is a specific contra-indication.

Rifampicin, a rifamycin, is a key component of any antituberculous regimen. Like isoniazid it should always be included unless there is a specific contra-indication.

During the first two months (‘initial phase’) of rifampicin administration transient disturbance of liver function with elevated serum transaminases is common but generally does not require interruption of treatment. Occasionally more serious liver toxicity requires a change of treatment particularly in those with pre-existing liver disease.

On intermittent treatment six toxicity syndromes have been recognised—influenza-like, abdominal, and respiratory symptoms, shock, renal failure, and thrombocytopenic purpura—and can occur in 20 to 30% of patients.

Rifabutin, another rifamycin, is indicated for prophylaxis against M. avium complex infections in patients with a low CD4 count; it is also licensed for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease and pulmonary tuberculosis.

Pyrazinamide is a bactericidal drug only active against intracellular dividing forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; it exerts its main effect only in the first two or three months. It is particularly useful in tuberculous meningitis because of good meningeal penetration. It is not active against M. bovis.

Ethambutol hydrochloride is included in a treatment regimen if isoniazid resistance is suspected; it can be omitted if the risk of resistance is low.

Streptomycin [unlicensed] is now rarely used in the UK except for resistant organisms.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis should be treated by a specialist physician with experience in such cases, and where appropriate facilities for infection-control exist. Second-line drugs available for infections caused by resistant organisms, or when first-line drugs cause unacceptable side-effects, include aminosalicylic acid, amikacin, capreomycin, cycloserine, newer macrolides (e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin), moxifloxacin and protionamide (prothionamide; no longer on UK market). Bedaquiline and delamanid are licensed for the treatment of multiple-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Bedaquiline has a long half-life.

      <i>Nocturnal enuresis</i> is common in young children, but persists in a small proportion by 10 years of age. For children under 5 years, reassurance and advice on the management of nocturnal enuresis can be useful for some families. Treatment may be considered in children over 5 years depending on their maturity and motivation, the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, and the needs of the child and their family.</p>
    <p>Initially, advice should be given on fluid intake, diet, toileting behaviour, and reward systems; for children who do not respond to this advice, further treatment may be necessary. An <b>enuresis alarm</b> should be first line treatment for motivated, well-supported children; alarms have a lower relapse rate than drug treatment when discontinued. Treatment should be reviewed after 4 weeks, and, if there are early signs of response, continued until a minimum of 2 weeks’ uninterrupted dry nights have been achieved. If complete dryness is not achieved after 3 months, only continue if the condition is still improving and the child remains motivated to use the alarm. If initial alarm treatment is unsuccessful, consider combination treatment with <b><xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/desmopressin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP4622\">desmopressin</xref></b>, or desmopressin alone if the alarm is no longer appropriate or desirable.</p>

Nocturnal enuresis is common in young children, but persists in a small proportion by 10 years of age. For children under 5 years, reassurance and advice on the management of nocturnal enuresis can be useful for some families. Treatment may be considered in children over 5 years depending on their maturity and motivation, the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, and the needs of the child and their family.

Initially, advice should be given on fluid intake, diet, toileting behaviour, and reward systems; for children who do not respond to this advice, further treatment may be necessary. An enuresis alarm should be first line treatment for motivated, well-supported children; alarms have a lower relapse rate than drug treatment when discontinued. Treatment should be reviewed after 4 weeks, and, if there are early signs of response, continued until a minimum of 2 weeks’ uninterrupted dry nights have been achieved. If complete dryness is not achieved after 3 months, only continue if the condition is still improving and the child remains motivated to use the alarm. If initial alarm treatment is unsuccessful, consider combination treatment with desmopressin, or desmopressin alone if the alarm is no longer appropriate or desirable.

Desmopressin is given by oral or by sublingual administration. Desmopressin alone can be offered to children over 5 years of age if an alarm is inappropriate or undesirable, or when rapid or short-term results are the priority (for example to cover periods away from home); desmopressin alone can also be used if there has been a partial response to a combination of desmopressin and an alarm following initial treatment with an alarm. Treatment should be assessed after 4 weeks and continued for 3 months if there are signs of response. Desmopressin should be withdrawn at regular intervals (for 1 week every 3 months) for full reassessment. When stopping treatment with desmopressin, gradual withdrawal should be considered.

Nocturnal enuresis associated with daytime symptoms (overactive bladder) can be managed with antimuscarinic drugs (see Urinary incontinence) in combination with desmopressin. Treatment should be prescribed only after specialist assessment and should be continued for 3 months; the course can be repeated if necessary.

The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine hydrochloride may be considered for children who have not responded to all other treatments and have undergone specialist assessment, however, behavioural disturbances can occur and relapse is common after withdrawal. Treatment should not normally exceed 3 months unless a physical examination is made and the child is fully reassessed; toxicity following overdosage with tricyclics is of particular concern.

Urinary-tract infection is more common in women than in men; when it occurs in men there is frequently an underlying abnormality of the renal tract. Recurrent episodes of infection are an indication for radiological investigation especially in children in whom untreated pyelonephritis may lead to permanent kidney damage.

Escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary-tract infection; Staphylococcus saprophyticus is also common in sexually active young women. Less common causes include Proteus and Klebsiella spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections usually occur in the hospital setting and may be associated with functional or anatomical abnormalities of the renal tract. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis infection may complicate catheterisation or instrumentation.

A specimen of urine should be collected for culture and sensitivity testing before starting antibacterial therapy;

in men;in pregnant women;in children under 3 years of age;in patients with suspected upper urinary-tract infection;complicated infection, or recurrent infection;if resistant organisms are suspected;if urine dipstick testing gives a single positive result for leucocyte esterase or nitrite;if clinical symptoms are not consistent with results of dipstick testing.Treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results. The antibacterial chosen should reflect current local bacterial sensitivity to antibacterials.

Antibacterial therapy for lower urinary-tract infections

Uncomplicated lower urinary-tract infections often respond to trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin, or alternatively, amoxicillin, ampicillin or oral cephalosporin.

Suggested duration of treatment is 7 days, but a short course (e.g. 3 days) is usually adequate for uncomplicated urinary-tract infections in women.

Infections caused by fully sensitive bacteria respond to amoxicillin.

Widespread bacterial resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim has been reported. Alternatives for resistant organisms include co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin with clavulanic acid), an oral cephalosporin, nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam hydrochloride, or a quinolone.

Fosfomycin [unlicensed] can be used, on the advice of a microbiologist, for the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary-tract infections caused by multiple-antibacterial resistant organisms when other antibacterials cannot be used.

Long-term low dose therapy may be required in selected patients to prevent recurrence of infection; indications include frequent relapses and significant kidney damage. Trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin and cefalexin have been recommended for long-term therapy.

Methenamine hippurate (hexamine hippurate) should not generally be used because it requires an acidic urine for its antimicrobial activity and it is ineffective for upper urinary-tract infections; it may, however, have a role in the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic or recurrent uncomplicated lower urinary-tract infections.

Antibacterial therapy for upper urinary-tract infections

Acute pyelonephritis can lead to septicaemia and is treated initially by injection of a broad-spectrum antibacterial such as a cephalosporin (e.g. cefuroxime) or a quinolone if the patient is severely ill; gentamicin can also be used.

Suggested duration of treatment is 10–14 days (longer treatment may be necessary in complicated pyelonephritis).

Prostatitis can be difficult to cure and requires treatment for several weeks with an antibacterial which penetrates prostatic tissue such as some of the quinolones (ciprofloxacinor ofloxacin), or alternatively, trimethoprim.

Suggested duration of treatment is 28 days.

Where infection is localised and associated with an indwelling catheter, a bladder instillation is often effective.

Pregnancy

Urinary-tract infection in pregnancy may be asymptomatic and requires prompt treatment to prevent progression to acute pyelonephritis. Penicillins and cephalosporins are suitable for treating urinary-tract infection during pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin may also be used but it should be avoided at term. Sulfonamides and quinolones should be avoided during pregnancy; trimethoprim should also preferably be avoided particularly in the first trimester.

Renal impairment

In renal failure antibacterials normally excreted by the kidney accumulate with resultant toxicity unless the dose is reduced. This applies especially to the aminoglycosides which should be used with great caution; tetracyclines, methenamine hippurate, and nitrofurantoin should be avoided altogether.

Urinary-tract infections in children require prompt antibacterial treatment to minimise the risk of renal scarring. Uncomplicated ‘lower’ urinary-tract infections in children over 3 months of age can be treated with trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, a first generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefalexin), or amoxicillin for 3 days; children should be reassessed if they continue to be unwell 24–48 hours after the initial assessment. Amoxicillin should only be used if the organism causing the infection is sensitive to it.

Acute pyelonephritis in children over 3 months of age can be treated with a first generation cephalosporin or co-amoxiclav for 7–10 days. If the patient is severely ill, then the infection is best treated initially by injection of a broad-spectrum antibacterial such as cefotaxime or co-amoxiclav; gentamicin is an alternative.

Children under 3 months of age should be transferred to hospital and treated initially with intravenous antibacterial drugs such as ampicillin with gentamicin, or cefotaxime alone, until the infection responds; full doses of oral antibacterials are then given for a further period.

Recurrent episodes of infection are an indication for imaging tests. Antibacterial prophylaxis with low doses of trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin may be considered for children with recurrent infection, significant urinary-tract anomalies, or significant kidney damage.

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Active immunity</p>
    <p>Active immunity can be acquired by natural disease or by vaccination. <b>Vaccines</b> stimulate production of antibodies and other components of the immune mechanism; they consist of either:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>a <i>live attenuated</i> form of a virus (e.g. measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) or bacteria (e.g. BCG vaccine), or</li>
      <li>
        <i>inactivated</i> preparations of the virus (e.g. influenza vaccine) or bacteria, or</li>
      <li>
        <i>detoxified exotoxins</i> produced by a micro-organism (e.g. tetanus vaccine), or</li>
      <li>
        <i>extracts of</i> a micro-organism, which may be derived from the organism (e.g. pneumococcal vaccine) or produced by recombinant DNA technology (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Live attenuated</b>
      <b>vaccines</b> usually produce a durable immunity, but not always as long-lasting as that resulting from natural infection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Inactivated vaccines</b> may require a primary series of injections of vaccine to produce an adequate antibody response, and in most cases booster (reinforcing) injections are required; the duration of immunity varies from months to many years. Some inactivated vaccines are adsorbed onto an adjuvant (such as aluminium hydroxide) to enhance the antibody response.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p>Advice reflects that in the handbook <i>Immunisation against Infectious Disease</i> (2013), which in turn reflects the guidance of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).</p>
      <p>Chapters from the handbook are available at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.immunisation.dh.gov.uk\">www.immunisation.dh.gov.uk</xref></p>

    <p>For the most up to date immunisation schedule consult 'The complete routine immunisation schedule', available at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk\">www.gov.uk</xref>.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Preterm birth</p>
      <p>Babies born preterm should receive all routine immunisations based on their actual date of birth. The risk of apnoea following vaccination is increased in preterm babies, particularly in those born at or before 28 weeks gestational age. If babies at risk of apnoea are in hospital at the time of their first immunisation, they should be monitored for 48 hours after immunisation. If a baby develops apnoea, bradycardia, or desaturation after the first immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital with similar monitoring. Seroconversion may be unreliable in babies born earlier than 28 weeks’ gestation or in babies treated with corticosteroids for chronic lung disease; consideration should be given to testing for antibodies against <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b, meningococcal C, and hepatitis B after primary immunisation.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Diphtheria vaccine</p>
    <p>Diphtheria-containing vaccines are prepared from the toxin of <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i><i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i></i></ph> and adsorption on aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate improves antigenicity. The vaccine stimulates the production of the protective antibody. The quantity of diphtheria toxoid in a preparation determines whether the vaccine is defined as ‘high dose’ or ‘low dose’. Vaccines containing the higher dose of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunisation of children under 10 years of age. Vaccines containing the lower dose of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunisation in adults and children over 10 years. Single-antigen diphtheria vaccine is not available and adsorbed diphtheria vaccine is given as a combination product containing other vaccines.</p>
    <p>For primary immunisation <i>of children aged between 2 months and 10 years</i> vaccination is recommended usually in the form of 3 doses (separated by 1-month intervals) of <b>diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component), poliomyelitis (inactivated) and haemophilus type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed)</b> (see Immunisation schedule). In unimmunised individuals aged <i>over 10 years</i> the primary course comprises of 3 doses of <b>adsorbed diphtheria</b> [low dose], <b>tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine</b>.</p>
    <p>A booster dose should be given 3 years after the primary course (this interval can be reduced to a minimum of 1 year if the primary course was delayed). Children <i>under 10 years</i> should receive <i>either</i><b>adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine</b><i>or</i><b>adsorbed diphtheria</b> [low dose], <b>tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine</b>. Individuals aged <i>over 10 years</i> should receive <b>adsorbed diphtheria</b> [low dose], <b>tetanus, and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine</b>.</p>
    <p>A second booster dose, of adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine, should be given 10 years after the previous booster dose (this interval can be reduced to a minimum of 5 years if previous doses were delayed).</p>

      <b>Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine</b> is made from capsular polysaccharide; it is conjugated with a protein such as tetanus toxoid to increase immunogenicity, especially in young children. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine immunisation is given in combination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine, as a component of the primary course of childhood immunisation (see Immunisation schedule). For infants under 1 year, the course consists of 3 doses of a vaccine containing <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i><i>Haemophilus influenzae</i></i></ph> type b component with an interval of 1 month between doses. A booster dose of haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine) should be given at 12–13 months of age.</p>
    <p>Children 1–10 years who have not been immunised against <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i><i>Haemophilus influenzae</i></i></ph> type b need to receive only 1 dose of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine).

    <p>In the UK, groups at high-risk of hepatitis B include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>parenteral drug misusers, their sexual partners, and household contacts; other drug misusers who are likely to ‘progress’ to injecting;</li>

    <p>Different immunisation schedules for <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/hepatitis-b-vaccine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8310\">hepatitis B vaccine</xref> are recommended for specific circumstances. Generally, three or four doses are required for primary immunisation; an ‘accelerated schedule’ is recommended for pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk groups where rapid protection is required, and for post-exposure prophylaxis.</p>
    <p>Immunisation may take up to 6 months to confer adequate protection; the duration of immunity is not known precisely, but a single booster 5 years after the primary course may be sufficient to maintain immunity for those who continue to be at risk.</p>
    <p>Immunisation does not eliminate the need for commonsense precautions for avoiding the risk of infection from known carriers by the routes of infection which have been clearly established, consult <i>Guidance for Clinical Health Care Workers: Protection against Infection with Blood-borne Viruses</i> (available at <xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk\">www.dh.gov.uk</xref>). Accidental inoculation of hepatitis B virus-infected blood into a wound, incision, needle-prick, or abrasion may lead to infection, whereas it is unlikely that indirect exposure to a carrier will do so.</p>
    <p>Following significant exposure to hepatitis B, an accelerated schedule, with the second dose given 1 month, and the third dose 2 months after the first dose, is recommended. For those at continued risk, a fourth dose should be given 12 months after the first dose. More detailed guidance is given in the handbook <i>Immunisation against Infectious Disease</i>.

    <p>Human papillomavirus vaccine is available as a bivalent vaccine (<i>Cervarix</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) or a quadrivalent vaccine (<i>Gardasil </i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />). <i>Cervarix</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> is licensed for use in females for the prevention of cervical cancer and other pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus types 16 and 18. <i>Gardasil </i> is licensed for use in females for the prevention of cervical and anal cancers, genital warts and pre-cancerous genital (cervical, vulvar, and vaginal) and anal lesions caused by human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The vaccines may also provide limited protection against disease caused by other types of human papillomavirus. The two vaccines are not interchangeable and one vaccine product should be used for an entire course.</p>
    <p>Human papillomavirus vaccine will be most effective if given before sexual activity starts. From September 2014, a 2-dose schedule is recommended, as long as the first dose is received before the age of 15 years. The first dose is given to females aged 11 to 14 years, and the second dose is given 6–24 months after the first dose (for the purposes of planning the national immunisation programme, it is appropriate to give the second dose 12 months after the first (see Immunisation schedule). If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, even if more than 24 months have elapsed since the first dose or if the girl is then aged 15 years or more. Females receiving their first dose aged 15 years or older require a 3-dose schedule (see <i>Cervarix</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" /> and <i>Gardasil</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />), with the second and third doses given 1 and 4–6 months after the first dose; all 3 doses should be given within a 12-month period. If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. If a 3-dose course of vaccination has been started before September 2014, then where possible this should be completed; if the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. Under the national programme in England, females remain eligible to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine up to the age of 18 years if they did not receive the vaccine when scheduled. Where appropriate, immunisation with human papillomavirus vaccine should be offered to females coming into the UK as they may not have been offered protection in their country of origin. The duration of protection has not been established, but current studies suggest that protection is maintained for at least 6 years after completion of the primary course.</p>
    <p>As the vaccines do not protect against all strains of human papillomavirus, routine cervical screening should continue.</p>

Acellular vaccines are derived from highly purified components of <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i><i>Bordetella pertussis</i></i></ph>. Primary immunisation against pertussis (whooping cough) requires 3 doses of an acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (see Immunisation schedule), given at intervals of 1 month from the age of 2 months.</p>
    <p>All children up to the age of 10 years should receive primary immunisation with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component), poliomyelitis (inactivated) and haemophilus type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed).</p>
    <p>A booster dose of an acellular pertussis-containing vaccine should ideally be given 3 years after the primary course, although, the interval can be reduced to 1 year if the primary course was delayed. Children aged 1–10 years who have not received a <i>pertussis-containing</i> vaccine as part of their primary immunisation should be offered 1 dose of a suitable pertussis-containing vaccine; after an interval of at least 1 year, a booster dose of a suitable pertussis-containing vaccine should be given.

      <p outputclass=\"title\">Vaccination of pregnant women against pertussis</p>
      <p>In response to the pertussis outbreak, the UK health departments introduced a temporary programme (October 2012) to vaccinate pregnant women against pertussis, and this programme will continue until further notice. The aim of the programme is to boost the levels of pertussis–specific antibodies that are transferred through the placenta, from the mother to the fetus, so that the newborn is protected before routine immunisation begins at 2 months of age.</p>
      <p>Pregnant women should be offered a single dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (as adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine; <i>Boostrix-IPV</i><tm tmtype=\"reg\" />) between 28 to 38 weeks of pregnancy; the optimal time for vaccination is between 28–32 weeks of pregnancy. Pregnant women should be offered a single dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine up to the onset of labour if they missed the opportunity for vaccination at 28–38 weeks of pregnancy. A single dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine may also be offered to new mothers, who have never previously been vaccinated against pertussis, until the child receives the first vaccination.</p>
      <p>While this programme is in place, women who become pregnant again should be offered vaccination during each pregnancy to maximise transplacental transfer of antibody.</p>

Children at increased risk of pneumococcal infection presenting late for vaccination should receive 2 doses (separated by at least 1 month) of the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) before the age of 12 months, and a third dose at 12–13 months. Children over 12 months and under 5 years (who have not been vaccinated or not completed the primary course) should receive a single dose of the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) (2 doses separated by an interval of 2 months in the immunocompromised or those with asplenia or splenic dysfunction). All children under 5 years at increased risk of pneumococcal infection should receive a single dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine after their second birthday and at least 2 months after the final dose of the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed).</p>

    <p>Two types of poliomyelitis vaccines (containing strains of poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3) are available, inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (for injection) and live (oral) poliomyelitis vaccine. <b>Inactivated</b> poliomyelitis vaccines, only available in combined preparation, is recommended for routine immunisation.</p>
    <p>A course of primary immunisation consists of 3 doses of a combined preparation containing inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines, starting at 2 months of age with intervals of 1 month between doses (see Immunisation schedule). A course of 3 doses should also be given to all unimmunised adults; no adult should remain unimmunised against poliomyelitis.</p>
    <p>Two booster doses of a preparation containing inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines are recommended, the first before school entry and the second before leaving school (see Immunisation schedule). Further booster doses are only necessary for adults at special risk, such as travellers to endemic areas, or laboratory staff likely to be exposed to the viruses, or healthcare workers in possible contact with cases; booster doses should be given to such individuals every 10 years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Live (oral) poliomyelitis vaccine</b> is no longer available for routine use; its use may be considered during large outbreaks, but advice should be sought from Public Health England. The live (oral) vaccine poses a very rare risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio because the attenuated strain of the virus can revert to a virulent form. For this reason the live (oral) vaccine must <b>not</b> be used for immunosuppressed individuals or their household contacts.

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Pre-exposure prophylaxis</p>
      <p>Immunisation should be offered to those at high risk of exposure to rabies— laboratory staff who handle the rabies virus, those working in quarantine stations, animal handlers, veterinary surgeons and field workers who are likely to be bitten by infected wild animals, certain port officials, and bat handlers. Transmission of rabies by humans has not been recorded but it is advised that those caring for patients with the disease should be vaccinated.</p>
      <p>Immunisation against rabies is also recommended where there is limited access to prompt medical care for those living in areas where rabies is enzootic, for those travelling to such areas for longer than 1 month, and for those on shorter visits who may be exposed to unusual risk.</p>
      <p>Immunisation against rabies is indicated during pregnancy if there is substantial risk of exposure to rabies and rapid access to post-exposure prophylaxis is likely to be limited.</p>
      <p>Up-to-date country-by-country information on the incidence of rabies can be obtained from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (<xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.nathnac.org\">www.nathnac.org</xref>) and, in Scotland, from Health Protection Scotland (<xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk\">www.hps.scot.nhs.uk</xref>).</p>

    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Post-exposure management</p>
      <p>Following potential exposure to rabies, the wound or site of exposure (e.g. mucous membrane) should be cleansed under running water and washed for several minutes with soapy water as soon as possible after exposure. Disinfectant and a simple dressing can be applied, but suturing should be delayed because it may increase the risk of introducing rabies virus into the nerves.</p>
      <p>Post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies depends on the level of risk in the country, the nature of exposure, and the individual’s immunity. In each case, expert risk assessment and advice on appropriate management should be obtained from the local Public Health England Centre or Public Health England’s Virus Reference Department, Colindale (tel. (020) 8200 4400) or the PHE Colindale Duty Doctor (tel. (020) 8200 6868), in Wales from the Public Health Wales local Health Protection Team or Public Health Wales Virus Reference Laboratory (tel.

      <p>There are no specific contra-indications to the use of <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rabies-vaccine.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8391\">rabies vaccine</xref> for post-exposure prophylaxis and its use should be considered whenever a patient has been attacked by an animal in a country where rabies is enzootic, even if there is no direct evidence of rabies in the attacking animal. Because of the potential consequences of untreated rabies exposure and because rabies vaccination has not been associated with fetal abnormalities, pregnancy is not considered a contra-indication to post-exposure prophylaxis.</p>
      <p>For post-exposure prophylaxis of <i>fully immunised</i> individuals (who have previously received pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis with cell-derived rabies vaccine), 2 doses of cell-derived vaccine are likely to be sufficient; the first dose is given on day 0 and the second dose is given between day 3–7. <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"drug/rabies-immunoglobulin.xml\" type=\"drug\" rel=\"drug\" bnfid=\"PHP8470\">Rabies immunoglobulin</xref> is not necessary in such cases.</p>

    <p outputclass=\"title\">Tetanus vaccine</p>
    <p>
      <b>Tetanus vaccine</b> contains a cell-free purified toxin of <ph outputclass=\"organism\"><i><i>Clostridium tetani</i></i></ph> adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate to improve antigenicity.</p>
    <p>Primary immunisation for children under 10 years consists of 3 doses of a combined preparation containing adsorbed tetanus vaccine, with an interval of 1 month between doses. Following routine childhood vaccination, 2 booster doses of a preparation containing adsorbed tetanus vaccine are recommended, the first before school entry and the second before leaving school (see Immunisation schedule).</p>
    <p>The recommended schedule of tetanus vaccination not only gives protection against tetanus in childhood but also gives the basic immunity for subsequent booster doses. In most circumstances, a total of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine is considered sufficient for long term protection.</p>
    <p>For primary immunisation of adults and children over 10 years previously unimmunised against tetanus, 3 doses of <b>adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine</b> are given with an interval of 1 month between doses (see Diphtheria-containing Vaccines).</p>
    <p>When an individual presents for a booster dose but has been vaccinated following a tetanus-prone wound, the vaccine preparation administered at the time of injury should be determined. If this is not possible, the booster should still be given to ensure adequate protection against all antigens in the booster vaccine.</p>
    <p>Very rarely, tetanus has developed after abdominal surgery; patients awaiting elective surgery should be asked about tetanus immunisation and immunised if necessary.</p>
    <p>Parenteral drug abuse is also associated with tetanus; those abusing drugs by injection should be vaccinated if unimmunised—booster doses should be given if there is any doubt about their immunisation status.</p>
    <p>All laboratory staff should be offered a primary course if unimmunised.</p>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Wounds</p>
      <p>Wounds are considered to be tetanus-prone if they are sustained more than 6 hours before surgical treatment or at any interval after injury and are puncture-type (particularly if contaminated with soil or manure) <i>or</i> show much devitalised tissue <i>or</i> are septic <i>or</i> are compound fractures <i>or</i> contain foreign bodies. All wounds should receive thorough cleansing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For <i>clean wounds</i>: fully immunised individuals (those who have received a total of 5 doses of a tetanus-containing vaccine at appropriate intervals) and those whose primary immunisation is complete (with boosters up to date), do not require tetanus vaccine; individuals whose primary immunisation is incomplete or whose boosters are not up to date require a reinforcing dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine (followed by further doses as required to complete the schedule); non-immunised individuals (or those whose immunisation status is not known or who have been fully immunised but are now immunocompromised) should be given a dose of the appropriate tetanus-containing vaccine immediately (followed by completion of the full course of the vaccine if records confirm the need)</li>
        <li>For <i>tetanus-prone wounds</i>: management is as for clean wounds with the addition of a dose of tetanus immunoglobulin given at a different site; in fully immunised individuals and those whose primary immunisation is complete (with boosters up to date) the immunoglobulin is needed only if the risk of infection is especially high (e.g. contamination with manure). Antibacterial prophylaxis (with benzylpenicillin, co-amoxiclav, or metronidazole) may also be required for tetanus-prone wounds.</li>

Active immunity can be acquired by natural disease or by vaccination. Vaccines stimulate production of antibodies and other components of the immune mechanism; they consist of either:

a live attenuated form of a virus (e.g. measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) or bacteria (e.g. BCG vaccine), orinactivated preparations of the virus (e.g. influenza vaccine) or bacteria, ordetoxified exotoxins produced by a micro-organism (e.g. tetanus vaccine), orextracts of a micro-organism, which may be derived from the organism (e.g. pneumococcal vaccine) or produced by recombinant DNA technology (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine).Live attenuatedvaccines usually produce a durable immunity, but not always as long-lasting as that resulting from natural infection.

Inactivated vaccines may require a primary series of injections of vaccine to produce an adequate antibody response, and in most cases booster (reinforcing) injections are required; the duration of immunity varies from months to many years. Some inactivated vaccines are adsorbed onto an adjuvant (such as aluminium hydroxide) to enhance the antibody response.

Advice reflects that in the handbook Immunisation against Infectious Disease (2013), which in turn reflects the guidance of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).

Chapters from the handbook are available at www.immunisation.dh.gov.uk

The advice also incorporates changes announced by the Chief Medical Officer and Health Department Updates.

Immunisation schedule

Vaccines for the childhood immunisation schedule should be obtained from local health organisations or from ImmForm (www.immform.dh.gov.uk)—not to be prescribed on FP10 (HS21 in Northern Ireland; GP10 in Scotland; WP10 in Wales).

For the most up to date immunisation schedule consult 'The complete routine immunisation schedule', available at www.gov.uk.

Preterm birth

Babies born preterm should receive all routine immunisations based on their actual date of birth. The risk of apnoea following vaccination is increased in preterm babies, particularly in those born at or before 28 weeks gestational age. If babies at risk of apnoea are in hospital at the time of their first immunisation, they should be monitored for 48 hours after immunisation. If a baby develops apnoea, bradycardia, or desaturation after the first immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital with similar monitoring. Seroconversion may be unreliable in babies born earlier than 28 weeks’ gestation or in babies treated with corticosteroids for chronic lung disease; consideration should be given to testing for antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae type b, meningococcal C, and hepatitis B after primary immunisation.

HIV-positive individuals with or without symptoms can receive the following live vaccines:

MMR (but avoid if immunity significantly impaired; use of normal immunoglobulin should be considered after exposure to measles), varicella-zoster vaccine against chickenpox (but avoid if immunity significantly impaired—consult product literature; varicella–zoster immunoglobulin should be considered after exposure to chickenpox or herpes zoster), rotavirus;and the following inactivated vaccines:

anthrax, cholera (oral), diphtheria, haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, influenza (injection), meningococcal, pertussis, pneumococcal, poliomyelitis, rabies, tetanus, tick-borne encephalitis, typhoid (injection).HIV-positive individuals should not receive:

BCG, influenza nasal spray (unless stable HIV infection and receiving antiretroviral therapy), typhoid (oral), yellow fever (if yellow fever risk is unavoidable, specialist advice should be sought)The above advice differs from that for other immunocompromised patients; Immunisation Guidelines for HIV-infected Adults issued by British HIV Association (BHIVA) are available at www.bhiva.org and, Immunisation of HIV-infected Children issued by Children's HIV Association (CHIVA) are available at www.chiva.org.uk

Vaccines and asplenia

The following vaccines are recommended for asplenic patients, those with splenic dysfunction or complement disorders, depending on the age at which their condition is diagnosed:

Haemophilus influenzae type B with meningococcal group C vaccine;Influenza vaccine;Meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine;pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.Children first diagnosed under 2 years of age should be vaccinated according to the Immunisation Schedule, including the 12 month boosters. If meningococcal group C vaccine has not yet been given as part of routine schedule, give one dose of meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine followed by a second dose at least one month apart. If meningococcal group C vaccine has already been given as part of routine schedule, then give one additional dose of meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine at least one month later. Following routine 12 month booster vaccines, give a dose of meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine and an additional dose of 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 2 months later. An additional dose of haemophilus influenzae type B with meningococcal group C vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be given after the second birthday. The influenza vaccine should be administered annually in children aged 6 months or older.

Children first diagnosed over 2 years of age should be vaccinated according to the Immunisation schedule, including the 12 month boosters. The child should receive one additional booster dose of haemophilus influenzae type B with meningococcal group C vaccine along with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, followed by one dose of meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine after 2 months. The influenza vaccine should be administered annually.

Anthrax vaccine

Anthrax vaccine is made from antigens from B. anthracis. Anthrax immunisation is indicated for individuals who handle infected animals, for those exposed to imported infected animal products, and for laboratory staff who work with B. anthracis. A 4-dose regimen is used for primary immunisation; booster doses should be given annually to workers at continued risk of exposure to anthrax.

In the event of possible contact with B. anthracis, post-exposure immunisation may be indicated, in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis. Advice on the use of anthrax vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis must be obtained from Public Health England Colindale (tel. 020 8200 4400).

BCG vaccine

Bacillus calmette-guérin vaccine should be given intradermally by operators skilled in the technique.

The expected reaction to successful bacillus calmette-guérin vaccine is induration at the site of injection followed by a local lesion which starts as a papule 2 or more weeks after vaccination; the lesion may ulcerate then subside over several weeks or months, leaving a small, flat scar. A dry dressing may be used if the ulcer discharges, but air should not be excluded.

BCG is recommended for the following groups if BCG immunisation has not previously been carried out and they are negative for tuberculoprotein hypersensitivity:

neonates with a family history of tuberculosis in the last 5 years;all neonates and infants (0–12 months) born in areas where the incidence of tuberculosis is greater than 40 per 100 000;neonates, infants, and children under 16 years with a parent or grandparent born in a country with an incidence of tuberculosis greater than 40 per 100 000;new immigrants aged under 16 years who were born in, or lived for more than 3 months in a country with an incidence of tuberculosis greater than 40 per 100 000;new immigrants aged 16–35 years from Sub-Saharan Africa or a country with an incidence of tuberculosis greater than 500 per 100 000;contacts aged under 36 years of those with active respiratory tuberculosis (for healthcare or laboratory workers who have had contact with clinical materials or patients with tuberculosis, age limit does not apply);healthcare workers and laboratory staff (irrespective of age) who are likely to have contact with patients, clinical materials, or derived isolates; other individuals under 35 years (there is inadequate evidence of protection by BCG vaccine in adults aged over 35 years; however, vaccination is recommended for healthcare workers irrespective of age because of the increased risk to them or their patients) at occupational risk including veterinary and other staff who handle animal species susceptible to tuberculosis, and staff working directly with prisoners, in care homes for the elderly, or in hostels or facilities for the homeless or refugees;individuals under 16 years intending to live with local people for more than 3 months in a country with an incidence of tuberculosis greater than 40 per 100 000.List of countries or primary care trusts where the incidence of tuberculosis is greater than 40 cases per 100 000 is available at www.gov.uk/phe.

Bladder instillations of BCG are licensed for the management of bladder carcinoma.

See also Tuberculosis for advice on chemoprophylaxis; for the treatment of infection following vaccination, seek expert advice.

Tuberculosis Diagnostic Agents

The Mantoux test is recommended for tuberculin skin testing, but no licensed preparation is currently available. Guidance for healthcare professionals is available at www.dh.gov.uk/immunisation.

In the Mantoux test, the diagnostic dose is administered by intradermal injection of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD).

The Heaf test (involving the use of multiple-puncture apparatus) is no longer available.

Two interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) tests are also available as an aid in the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection: QuantiFERONTB Gold and T-SPOT.TB. Both tests measure T-cell mediated immune response to synthetic antigens. For further information on the use of interferon gamma release assay tests for tuberculosis, see www.gov.uk/phe.

Botulism antitoxin

A polyvalent botulism antitoxin is available for the post-exposure prophylaxis of botulism and for the treatment of persons thought to be suffering from botulism. It specifically neutralises the toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum types A, B, and E. It is not effective against infantile botulism as the toxin (type A) is seldom, if ever, found in the blood in this type of infection.

Cholera vaccine

Cholera vaccine (oral) contains inactivated Inaba (including El-Tor biotype) and Ogawa strains of Vibrio cholerae, serotype O1 together with recombinant B-subunit of the cholera toxin produced in Inaba strains of V.cholerae, serotype O1.

Oral cholera vaccine is licensed for travellers to endemic or epidemic areas on the basis of current recommendations. Immunisation should be completed at least 1 week before potential exposure. However, there is no requirement for cholera vaccination for international travel.

Injectable cholera vaccine provides unreliable protection and is no longer available in the UK.

Diphtheria vaccine

Diphtheria-containing vaccines are prepared from the toxin of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and adsorption on aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate improves antigenicity. The vaccine stimulates the production of the protective antibody. The quantity of diphtheria toxoid in a preparation determines whether the vaccine is defined as ‘high dose’ or ‘low dose’. Vaccines containing the higher dose of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunisation of children under 10 years of age. Vaccines containing the lower dose of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunisation in adults and children over 10 years. Single-antigen diphtheria vaccine is not available and adsorbed diphtheria vaccine is given as a combination product containing other vaccines.

For primary immunisation of children aged between 2 months and 10 years vaccination is recommended usually in the form of 3 doses (separated by 1-month intervals) of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component), poliomyelitis (inactivated) and haemophilus type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) (see Immunisation schedule). In unimmunised individuals aged over 10 years the primary course comprises of 3 doses of adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine.

A booster dose should be given 3 years after the primary course (this interval can be reduced to a minimum of 1 year if the primary course was delayed). Children under 10 years should receive eitheradsorbed diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccineoradsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine. Individuals aged over 10 years should receive adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus, and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine.

A second booster dose, of adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine, should be given 10 years after the previous booster dose (this interval can be reduced to a minimum of 5 years if previous doses were delayed).

Diphtheria-containing vaccines for children over 10 years and adults

A low dose of diphtheria toxoid is sufficient to recall immunity in individuals previously immunised against diphtheria but whose immunity may have diminished with time; it is insufficient to cause serious reactions in an individual who is already immune. Preparations containing low dose diphtheria should be used for adults and children over 10 years, for both primary immunisation and booster doses.

Travel

Those intending to travel to areas with a risk of diphtheria infection should be fully immunised according to the UK schedule. If more than 10 years have lapsed since completion of the UK schedule, a dose of adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine should be administered.

Contacts

Staff in contact with diphtheria patients or with potentially pathogenic clinical specimens or working directly with C. diphtheriae or C. ulcerans should receive a booster dose if fully immunised (with 5 doses of diphtheria-containing vaccine given at appropriate intervals); further doses should be given at 10-year intervals if risk persists. Individuals at risk who are not fully immunised should complete the primary course; a booster dose should be given after 5 years and then at 10-year intervals. Adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine is used for this purpose; immunity should be checked by antibody testing at least 3 months after completion of immunisation.

Advice on the management of cases, carriers, contacts and outbreaks must be sought from health protection units. The immunisation history of infected individuals and their contacts should be determined; those who have been incompletely immunised should complete their immunisation and fully immunised individuals should receive a reinforcing dose. See advice on antibacterial treatment to prevent a secondary case of diphtheria in a non-immune individual.

Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccine

Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine is made from capsular polysaccharide; it is conjugated with a protein such as tetanus toxoid to increase immunogenicity, especially in young children. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine immunisation is given in combination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine, as a component of the primary course of childhood immunisation (see Immunisation schedule). For infants under 1 year, the course consists of 3 doses of a vaccine containing Haemophilus influenzae type b component with an interval of 1 month between doses. A booster dose of haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine) should be given at 12–13 months of age.

Children 1–10 years who have not been immunised against Haemophilus influenzae type b need to receive only 1 dose of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine). However, if a primary course of immunisation has not been completed, these children should be given 3 doses of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component), and poliomyelitis (inactivated). The risk of infection falls sharply in older children and the vaccine is not normally required for children over 10 years.

Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine may be given to those over 10 years who are considered to be at increased risk of invasive H. influenzae type b disease (such as those with sickle-cell disease or complement deficiency, or those receiving treatment for malignancy).

Invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease

After recovery from infection, unimmunised and partially immunised index cases under 10 years of age should complete their age-specific course of immunisation. Previously vaccinated cases under 10 years of age should be given an additional dose of haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine) if Hib antibody concentrations are low or if it is not possible to measure antibody concentrations. Index cases of any age with asplenia or splenic dysfunction should complete their immunisation according to the recommendations below; fully vaccinated cases with asplenia or splenic dysfunction should be given an additional dose of haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine) if they received their previous dose over 1 year ago.

See also use of rifampicin in the prevention of secondary cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease.

Hepatitis A vaccine

Hepatitis A vaccine is prepared from formaldehyde-inactivated hepatitis A virus grown in human diploid cells.

Immunisation is recommended for:

laboratory staff who work directly with the virus;staff and residents of homes for those with severe learning difficulties;workers at risk of exposure to untreated sewage;individuals who work with primates;patients with haemophilia or other conditions treated with plasma-derived clotting factors;patients with severe liver disease;travellers to high-risk areas;individuals who are at risk due to their sexual behaviour;parenteral drug abusers.Immunisation should be considered for:

patients with chronic liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C;prevention of secondary cases in close contacts of confirmed cases of hepatitis A, within 14 days of exposure to the primary case (within 8 weeks of exposure to the primary case where there is more than 1 contact in the household).A booster dose is usually given 6–12 months after the initial dose. A second booster dose can be given 20 years after the previous booster dose to those who continue to be at risk. Specialist advice should be sought on re-immunisation of immunocompromised individuals.

For rapid protection against hepatitis A after exposure or during an outbreak, in adults a single dose of a monovalent vaccine is recommended; for children under 16 years, a single dose of the combined vaccine Ambirix can also be used.

Intramuscular normal immunoglobulin is recommended for use in addition to hepatitis A vaccine for close contacts (of confirmed cases of hepatitis A) who have chronic liver disease or HIV infection, or who are immunosuppressed or over 50 years of age.

Post-exposure prophylaxis is not required for healthy children under 1 year of age, so long as all those involved in nappy changing are vaccinated against hepatitis A. However, children 2–12 months of age can be given a dose of hepatitis A vaccine if it is not possible to vaccinate their carers, or if the child becomes a source of infection to others [unlicensed use]; in these cases, if the child goes on to require long-term protection against hepatitis A after the first birthday, the full course of 2 doses should be given.

Hepatitis B vaccine

Hepatitis B vaccine contains inactivated hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. It is made biosynthetically using recombinant DNA technology. The vaccine is used in individuals at high risk of contracting hepatitis B.

In the UK, groups at high-risk of hepatitis B include:

parenteral drug misusers, their sexual partners, and household contacts; other drug misusers who are likely to ‘progress’ to injecting;individuals who change sexual partners frequently;close family contacts of a case or individual with chronic hepatitis B infection;babies whose mothers have had acute hepatitis B during pregnancy or are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (regardless of e-antigen markers); hepatitis B vaccination is started immediately on delivery and hepatitis B immunoglobulin given at the same time (but preferably at a different site). Babies whose mothers are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and for e-antigen antibody should receive the vaccine only (but babies weighing 1.5 kg or less should also receive the immunoglobulin regardless of the mother’s e-antigen antibody status);individuals with haemophilia, those receiving regular blood transfusions or blood products, and carers responsible for the administration of such products;patients with chronic renal failure including those on haemodialysis. Haemodialysis patients should be monitored for antibodies annually and re-immunised if necessary. Home carers (of dialysis patients) should be vaccinated;individuals with chronic liver disease;healthcare personnel (including trainees) who have direct contact with blood or blood-stained body fluids or with patients’ tissues;laboratory staff who handle material that may contain the virus;other occupational risk groups such as morticians and embalmers;staff and patients of day-care or residential accommodation for those with severe learning difficulties;staff and inmates of custodial institutions;those travelling to areas of high or intermediate prevalence who are at increased risk or who plan to remain there for lengthy periods;families adopting children from countries with a high or intermediate prevalence of hepatitis B;foster carers and their families.Different immunisation schedules for hepatitis B vaccine are recommended for specific circumstances. Generally, three or four doses are required for primary immunisation; an ‘accelerated schedule’ is recommended for pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk groups where rapid protection is required, and for post-exposure prophylaxis.

Immunisation may take up to 6 months to confer adequate protection; the duration of immunity is not known precisely, but a single booster 5 years after the primary course may be sufficient to maintain immunity for those who continue to be at risk.

Immunisation does not eliminate the need for commonsense precautions for avoiding the risk of infection from known carriers by the routes of infection which have been clearly established, consult Guidance for Clinical Health Care Workers: Protection against Infection with Blood-borne Viruses (available at www.dh.gov.uk). Accidental inoculation of hepatitis B virus-infected blood into a wound, incision, needle-prick, or abrasion may lead to infection, whereas it is unlikely that indirect exposure to a carrier will do so.

Following significant exposure to hepatitis B, an accelerated schedule, with the second dose given 1 month, and the third dose 2 months after the first dose, is recommended. For those at continued risk, a fourth dose should be given 12 months after the first dose. More detailed guidance is given in the handbook Immunisation against Infectious Disease. Specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin (‘HBIG’) is available for use with the vaccine in those accidentally inoculated and in neonates at special risk of infection.

A combined hepatitis A and B vaccine is also available.

Human papillomavirus vaccine

Human papillomavirus vaccine is available as a bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) or a quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil ). Cervarix is licensed for use in females for the prevention of cervical cancer and other pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus types 16 and 18. Gardasil  is licensed for use in females for the prevention of cervical and anal cancers, genital warts and pre-cancerous genital (cervical, vulvar, and vaginal) and anal lesions caused by human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The vaccines may also provide limited protection against disease caused by other types of human papillomavirus. The two vaccines are not interchangeable and one vaccine product should be used for an entire course.

Human papillomavirus vaccine will be most effective if given before sexual activity starts. From September 2014, a 2-dose schedule is recommended, as long as the first dose is received before the age of 15 years. The first dose is given to females aged 11 to 14 years, and the second dose is given 6–24 months after the first dose (for the purposes of planning the national immunisation programme, it is appropriate to give the second dose 12 months after the first (see Immunisation schedule). If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, even if more than 24 months have elapsed since the first dose or if the girl is then aged 15 years or more. Females receiving their first dose aged 15 years or older require a 3-dose schedule (see Cervarix and Gardasil), with the second and third doses given 1 and 4–6 months after the first dose; all 3 doses should be given within a 12-month period. If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. If a 3-dose course of vaccination has been started before September 2014, then where possible this should be completed; if the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. Under the national programme in England, females remain eligible to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine up to the age of 18 years if they did not receive the vaccine when scheduled. Where appropriate, immunisation with human papillomavirus vaccine should be offered to females coming into the UK as they may not have been offered protection in their country of origin. The duration of protection has not been established, but current studies suggest that protection is maintained for at least 6 years after completion of the primary course.

As the vaccines do not protect against all strains of human papillomavirus, routine cervical screening should continue.

Influenza vaccine

While most viruses are antigenically stable, the influenza viruses A and B (especially A) are constantly altering their antigenic structure as indicated by changes in the haemagglutinins (H) and neuraminidases (N) on the surface of the viruses. It is essential that influenza vaccine in use contain the H and N components of the prevalent strain or strains as recommended each year by the World Health Organization.

Immunisation is recommended for persons at high risk, and to reduce transmission of infection. Annual immunisation is strongly recommended for individuals aged over 6 months with the following conditions:

chronic respiratory disease (includes asthma treated with continuous or repeated use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids or asthma with previous exacerbations requiring hospital admission);chronic heart disease;chronic liver disease;chronic renal disease;chronic neurological disease;complement disorders;diabetes mellitus;immunosuppression because of disease (including asplenia or splenic dysfunction) or treatment (including prolonged systemic corticosteroid treatment [for over 1 month at dose equivalents of prednisolone: adult and child over 20 kg, 20 mg or more daily; child under 20 kg, 1 mg/kg or more daily] and chemotherapy);HIV infection (regardless of immune status).Seasonal influenza vaccine is also recommended for all pregnant women, for all persons aged over 65 years, for residents of nursing or residential homes for the elderly and other long-stay facilities, and for carers of persons whose welfare may be at risk if the carer falls ill. Influenza immunisation should also be considered for household contacts of immunocompromised individuals.

As part of winter planning, NHS employers should offer vaccination to healthcare workers who are directly involved in patient care. Employers of social care workers should consider similar action.

Unless contra-indicated, the live influenza vaccine, Fluenz Tetra, is preferred in children aged 2–18 years because it provides a higher level of protection than inactivated influenza vaccine. From September 2015, seasonal influenza vaccine will also be offered to all children aged 2–6 years (including those in school years 1 and 2).

Information on pandemic influenza, avian influenza and swine influenza may be found at www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu and at www.gov.uk/phe.

Japanese encephalitis vaccine

Japanese encephalitis vaccine is indicated for travellers to areas in Asia and the Far East where infection is endemic and for laboratory staff at risk of exposure to the virus. The primary immunisation course of 2 doses should be completed at least one week before potential exposure to Japanese encephalitis virus.

Up-to-date information on the risk of Japanese encephalitis in specific countries can be obtained from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (www.nathnac.org).

Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine

Measles vaccine has been replaced by a combined live measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live (MMR vaccine).

Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live aims to eliminate measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles) and congenital rubella syndrome. Every child should receive two doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live by entry to primary school, unless there is a valid contra-indication. Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live should be given irrespective of previous measles, mumps, or rubella infection or vaccination.

The first dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live is given to children aged 12–13 months. A second dose is given before starting school at 3 years and 4 months–5 years of age (see Immunisation Schedule).

Children presenting for pre-school booster who have not received the first dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live should be given a dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live followed 3 months later by a second dose.

At school-leaving age or at entry into further education, measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live immunisation should be offered to individuals of both sexes who have not received 2 doses during childhood. In those who have received only a single dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live in childhood, a second dose is recommended to achieve full protection. If 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live are required, the second dose should be given one month after the initial dose. The decision on whether to vaccinate adults should take into consideration their vaccination history, the likelihood of the individual remaining susceptible, and the future risk of exposure and disease.

Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live should be used to protect against rubella in seronegative women of child-bearing age (see Immunisation Schedule); unimmunised healthcare workers who might put pregnant women and other vulnerable groups at risk of rubella or measles should be vaccinated. Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live may also be offered to previously unimmunised and seronegative post-partum women (see measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live)—vaccination a few days after delivery is important because about 60% of congenital abnormalities from rubella infection occur in babies of women who have borne more than one child. Immigrants arriving after the age of school immunisation are particularly likely to require immunisation.

Contacts

Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live may also be used in the control of outbreaks of measles and should be offered to susceptible children aged over 6 months who are contacts of a case, within 3 days of exposure to infection. Children immunised before 12 months of age should still receive two doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live at the recommended ages. If one dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live has already been given to a child, then the second dose may be brought forward to at least one month after the first, to ensure complete protection. If the child is under 18 months of age and the second dose is given within 3 months of the first, then the routine dose before starting school at 3 years and 4 months–5 years should still be given. Children aged under 9 months for whom avoidance of measles infection is particularly important (such as those with history of recent severe illness) can be given normal immunoglobulin after exposure to measles; routine measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live immunisation should then be given after at least 3 months at the appropriate age.

Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live is not suitable for prophylaxis following exposure to mumps or rubella since the antibody response to the mumps and rubella components is too slow for effective prophylaxis.

Children and adults with impaired immune response should not receive live vaccines (see advice on HIV). If they have been exposed to measles infection they should be given normal immunoglobulin.

Travel

Unimmunised travellers, including children over 6 months, to areas where measles is endemic or epidemic should receive measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live. Children immunised before 12 months of age should still receive two doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live at the recommended ages. If one dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, live has already been given to a child, then the second dose should be brought forward to at least one month after the first, to ensure complete protection. If the child is under 18 months of age and the second dose is given within 3 months of the first, then the routine dose before starting school at 3 years and 4 months–5 years should still be given.

Meningococcal vaccines

Almost all childhood meningococcal disease in the UK is caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C. Meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine protects only against infection by serogroup C and Meningococcal group B vaccine protects only against infection by serogroup B. The risk of meningococcal disease declines with age—immunisation is not generally recommended after the age of 25 years.

Tetravalent meningococcal vaccines that cover serogroups A, C, W135, and Y are available. Although the duration of protection has not been established, the meningococcal groups A, C, W135, and Y conjugate vaccine is likely to provide longer-lasting protection than the unconjugated meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The antibody response to serogroup C in unconjugated meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines in young children may be suboptimal [not currently available in the UK].

A meningococcal group B vaccine, Bexsero, is licensed in the UK against infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B and is recommended in the Immunisation Schedule.Bexsero contains 3 recombinant Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B proteins and the outer membrane vesicles from the NZ 98/254 strain, in order to achieve broad protection against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B; the proteins are adsorbed onto an aluminium compound to stimulate an enhanced immune response.

Childhood immunisation

Meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine provides long-term protection against infection by serogroup C of Neisseria meningitidis. Immunisation consists of 1 dose given at 3 months of age; 2 booster doses are recommended, the first is given at 12–13 months of age (combined with haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine), and the second is given at 13–15 years of age (combined with meningococcal A, W135 and Y vaccine) (see Immunisation Schedule).

Meningococcal group B vaccine provides protection against infection by serogroup B of Neisseria meningitidis. Immunisation consists of 1 dose given at 2 months of age, a second dose at 4 months of age, and a booster dose at 12 months of age (see Immunisation Schedule).

Unimmunised children aged under 12 months should be given 1 dose of meningococcal group B and group C conjugate vaccines, followed by a second dose of meningococcal group B vaccine (rDNA, component, adsorbed) two months later. They should then be vaccinated according to the Immunisation Schedule. Unimmunised children aged 12–23 months should be given a single dose of the meningococcal group C vaccine and 2 doses of meningococcal group B vaccine (rDNA, component, adsorbed) separated by an interval of two months. Children aged 2–9 years who have not received the meningococcal group C vaccine since 12-13 months should be given a single dose of meningococcal group C vaccine only, followed by a booster dose of meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine at 13–15 years of age.

From 2015, unimmunised individuals aged 10–25 years, including those aged under 25 years who are attending university for the first time, should be given a single dose of meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine; a booster dose is not required. All students attending university for the first time who are unvaccinated against meningococcal group C, irrespective of age, should be offered a single dose of meningococcal group C vaccine.

Patients under 25 years of age with confirmed serogroup C disease, who have previously been immunised with meningococcal group C vaccine, should be offered meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine before discharge from hospital.

Travel

Individuals travelling to countries of risk should be immunised with meningococcal groups A, C, W135, and Y conjugate vaccine, even if they have previously received meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine. If an individual has recently received meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine, an interval of at least 4 weeks should be allowed before administration of the tetravalent (meningococcal groups A, C, W135, and Y) vaccine.

Vaccination is particularly important for those living or working with local people or visiting an area of risk during outbreaks.

Immunisation recommendations and requirements for visa entry for individual countries should be checked before travelling, particularly to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Indian sub-continent where epidemics of meningococcal outbreaks and infection are reported. Country-by-country information is available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (www.nathnac.org).

Proof of vaccination with the tetravalent meningococcal groups A with C and W135 and Y vaccine is required for those travelling to Saudi Arabia during the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages (where outbreaks of the W135 strain have occurred).

Contacts

For advice on the immunisation of laboratory workers and close contacts of cases of meningococcal disease in the UK and on the role of the vaccine in the control of local outbreaks, consult Guidance for Public Health Management of Meningococcal Disease in the UK at www.gov.uk/phe. Also see for antibacterial prophylaxis for prevention of secondary cases of meningococcal meningitis.

The need for immunisation of laboratory staff who work directly with Neisseria meningitidis should be considered.

Pertussis vaccine

Pertussis vaccine is given as a combination preparation containing other vaccines. Acellular vaccines are derived from highly purified components of Bordetella pertussis. Primary immunisation against pertussis (whooping cough) requires 3 doses of an acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (see Immunisation schedule), given at intervals of 1 month from the age of 2 months.

All children up to the age of 10 years should receive primary immunisation with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component), poliomyelitis (inactivated) and haemophilus type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed).

A booster dose of an acellular pertussis-containing vaccine should ideally be given 3 years after the primary course, although, the interval can be reduced to 1 year if the primary course was delayed. Children aged 1–10 years who have not received a pertussis-containing vaccine as part of their primary immunisation should be offered 1 dose of a suitable pertussis-containing vaccine; after an interval of at least 1 year, a booster dose of a suitable pertussis-containing vaccine should be given. Immunisation against pertussis is not routinely recommended in individuals over 10 years of age.

Vaccination of pregnant women against pertussis

In response to the pertussis outbreak, the UK health departments introduced a temporary programme (October 2012) to vaccinate pregnant women against pertussis, and this programme will continue until further notice. The aim of the programme is to boost the levels of pertussis–specific antibodies that are transferred through the placenta, from the mother to the fetus, so that the newborn is protected before routine immunisation begins at 2 months of age.

Pregnant women should be offered a single dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (as adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine; Boostrix-IPV) between 28 to 38 weeks of pregnancy; the optimal time for vaccination is between 28–32 weeks of pregnancy. Pregnant women should be offered a single dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine up to the onset of labour if they missed the opportunity for vaccination at 28–38 weeks of pregnancy. A single dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine may also be offered to new mothers, who have never previously been vaccinated against pertussis, until the child receives the first vaccination.

While this programme is in place, women who become pregnant again should be offered vaccination during each pregnancy to maximise transplacental transfer of antibody.

Contacts

Vaccination against pertussis should be considered for close contacts of cases with pertussis who have been offered antibacterial prophylaxis. Unimmunised or partially immunised contacts under 10 years of age should complete their vaccination against pertussis. A booster dose of an acellular pertussis-containing vaccine is recommended for contacts aged over 10 years who have not received a pertussis-containing vaccine in the last 5 years and who have not received adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus, and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine in the last month.

Side-effects

Local reactions do not contra-indicate further doses.

The vaccine should not be withheld from children with a history to a preceding dose of:

fever, irrespective of severity;persistent crying or screaming for more than 3 hours;severe local reaction, irrespective of extent.Pneumococcal vaccine

Pneumococcal vaccine protects against infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus); the vaccines contain polysaccharide from capsular pneumococci. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine contains purified polysaccharide from 23 capsular types of pneumococci, whereas pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) contains polysaccharide from either 10 capsular types (Synflorix) or 13 capsular types (Prevenar 13) and the polysaccharide is conjugated to protein.

The 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13) is used in the childhood immunisation schedule. The recommended schedule consists of 3 doses, the first at 2 months of age, the second at 4 months, and the third at 12–13 months (see Immunisation Schedule).

Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for individuals at increased risk of pneumococcal infection as follows:

age over 65 years;asplenia or splenic dysfunction (including homozygous sickle cell disease and coeliac disease which could lead to splenic dysfunction);chronic respiratory disease (includes asthma treated with continuous or frequent use of a systemic corticosteroid);chronic heart disease;chronic renal disease;chronic liver disease;chronic neurological conditions;complement disorders;diabetes mellitus requiring insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs;immune deficiency because of disease (e.g. HIV infection) or treatment (including prolonged systemic corticosteroid treatment for over 1 month at dose equivalents of prednisolone: adult and child over 20 kg, 20 mg or more daily; child under 20 kg, 1 mg/kg or more daily);presence of cochlear implant;conditions where leakage of cerebrospinal fluid may occur;child under 5 years with a history of invasive pneumococcal disease;at risk of occupational exposure to metal fume (e.g. welders).Where possible, the vaccine should be given at least 2 weeks before splenectomy, cochlear implant surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy; patients should be given advice about increased risk of pneumococcal infection. If it is not practical to vaccinate at least 2 weeks before splenectomy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, the vaccine should be given at least 2 weeks after the splenectomy or, where possible, at least 3 months after completion of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Prophylactic antibacterial therapy against pneumococcal infection should not be stopped after immunisation. A patient card and information leaflet for patients with asplenia are available from the Department of Health or in Scotland from the Scottish Executive, Public Health Division 1 (Tel (0131) 244 2501).

Choice of vaccine

Children under 2 years at increased risk of pneumococcal infection (see list) should receive the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) at the recommended ages, followed by a single dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine after their second birthday. Children at increased risk of pneumococcal infection presenting late for vaccination should receive 2 doses (separated by at least 1 month) of the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) before the age of 12 months, and a third dose at 12–13 months. Children over 12 months and under 5 years (who have not been vaccinated or not completed the primary course) should receive a single dose of the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed) (2 doses separated by an interval of 2 months in the immunocompromised or those with asplenia or splenic dysfunction). All children under 5 years at increased risk of pneumococcal infection should receive a single dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine after their second birthday and at least 2 months after the final dose of the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (adsorbed).

Children over 5 years and adults who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease should receive a single dose of the 23-valent unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.

Revaccination

In individuals with higher concentrations of antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharides, revaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine more commonly produces adverse reactions. Revaccination is therefore not recommended, except every 5 years in individuals in whom the antibody concentration is likely to decline rapidly (e.g. asplenia, splenic dysfunction and nephrotic syndrome). If there is doubt, the need for revaccination should be discussed with a haematologist, immunologist, or microbiologist.

Poliomyelitis vaccine

Two types of poliomyelitis vaccines (containing strains of poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3) are available, inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (for injection) and live (oral) poliomyelitis vaccine. Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines, only available in combined preparation, is recommended for routine immunisation.

A course of primary immunisation consists of 3 doses of a combined preparation containing inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines, starting at 2 months of age with intervals of 1 month between doses (see Immunisation schedule). A course of 3 doses should also be given to all unimmunised adults; no adult should remain unimmunised against poliomyelitis.

Two booster doses of a preparation containing inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines are recommended, the first before school entry and the second before leaving school (see Immunisation schedule). Further booster doses are only necessary for adults at special risk, such as travellers to endemic areas, or laboratory staff likely to be exposed to the viruses, or healthcare workers in possible contact with cases; booster doses should be given to such individuals every 10 years.

Live (oral) poliomyelitis vaccine is no longer available for routine use; its use may be considered during large outbreaks, but advice should be sought from Public Health England. The live (oral) vaccine poses a very rare risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio because the attenuated strain of the virus can revert to a virulent form. For this reason the live (oral) vaccine must not be used for immunosuppressed individuals or their household contacts. The use of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines removes the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio altogether. 

Travel

Unimmunised travellers to areas with a high incidence of poliomyelitis should receive a full 3-dose course of a preparation containing inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines. Those who have not been vaccinated in the last 10 years should receive a booster dose of adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine. Information about countries with a high incidence of poliomyelitis can be obtained from www.travax.nhs.uk or from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (www.nathnac.org).

Rabies vaccine

Rabies vaccine contains inactivated rabies virus cultivated in either human diploid cells or purified chick embryo cells; vaccines are used for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis

Immunisation should be offered to those at high risk of exposure to rabies— laboratory staff who handle the rabies virus, those working in quarantine stations, animal handlers, veterinary surgeons and field workers who are likely to be bitten by infected wild animals, certain port officials, and bat handlers. Transmission of rabies by humans has not been recorded but it is advised that those caring for patients with the disease should be vaccinated.

Immunisation against rabies is also recommended where there is limited access to prompt medical care for those living in areas where rabies is enzootic, for those travelling to such areas for longer than 1 month, and for those on shorter visits who may be exposed to unusual risk.

Immunisation against rabies is indicated during pregnancy if there is substantial risk of exposure to rabies and rapid access to post-exposure prophylaxis is likely to be limited.

Up-to-date country-by-country information on the incidence of rabies can be obtained from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (www.nathnac.org) and, in Scotland, from Health Protection Scotland (www.hps.scot.nhs.uk).

Immunisation against rabies requires 3 doses of rabies vaccine, with further booster doses for those who remain at frequent risk. To ensure continued protection in persons at high risk (e.g. laboratory workers), the concentration of antirabies antibodies in plasma is used to determine the intervals between doses.

Post-exposure management

Following potential exposure to rabies, the wound or site of exposure (e.g. mucous membrane) should be cleansed under running water and washed for several minutes with soapy water as soon as possible after exposure. Disinfectant and a simple dressing can be applied, but suturing should be delayed because it may increase the risk of introducing rabies virus into the nerves.

Post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies depends on the level of risk in the country, the nature of exposure, and the individual’s immunity. In each case, expert risk assessment and advice on appropriate management should be obtained from the local Public Health England Centre or Public Health England’s Virus Reference Department, Colindale (tel. (020) 8200 4400) or the PHE Colindale Duty Doctor (tel. (020) 8200 6868), in Wales from the Public Health Wales local Health Protection Team or Public Health Wales Virus Reference Laboratory (tel. (029) 2074 7747), in Scotland from the local on-call infectious diseases consultant, and in Northern Ireland from the Public Health Agency Duty Room (tel (028) 9055 3997/ (028) 9063 2662) or the Regional Virology Service (tel. (028) 9024 0503).

There are no specific contra-indications to the use of rabies vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis and its use should be considered whenever a patient has been attacked by an animal in a country where rabies is enzootic, even if there is no direct evidence of rabies in the attacking animal. Because of the potential consequences of untreated rabies exposure and because rabies vaccination has not been associated with fetal abnormalities, pregnancy is not considered a contra-indication to post-exposure prophylaxis.

For post-exposure prophylaxis of fully immunised individuals (who have previously received pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis with cell-derived rabies vaccine), 2 doses of cell-derived vaccine are likely to be sufficient; the first dose is given on day 0 and the second dose is given between day 3–7. Rabies immunoglobulin is not necessary in such cases.

Post-exposure treatment forunimmunised individuals (or those whose prophylaxis is possibly incomplete) comprises 5 doses of rabies vaccine given over 1 month (on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and the fifth dose is given between day 28–30); also, depending on the level of risk (determined by factors such as the nature of the bite and the country where it was sustained), rabies immunoglobulin is given to unimmunised individuals on day 0 or within 7 days of starting the course of rabies vaccine. The immunisation course can be discontinued if it is proved that the individual was not at risk.

Rotavirus vaccine

Rotavirus vaccine is a live, oral vaccine that protects young children against gastro-enteritis caused by rotavirus infection. The recommended schedule consists of 2 doses, the first at 2 months of age, and the second at 3 months of age (see Immunisation schedule). The first dose of rotavirus vaccine must be given between 6–15 weeks of age and the second dose should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks; the vaccine should not be started in children 15 weeks of age or older. Ideally, the full course should be completed before 16 weeks of age to provide protection before the main burden of disease, and to avoid a temporal association between vaccination and intussusception; the course must be completed before 24 weeks of age.

The rotavirus vaccine virus is excreted in the stool and may be transmitted to close contacts; however, vaccination of those with immunosuppressed close contacts may protect the contacts from wild-type rotavirus disease and outweigh any risk from transmission of vaccine virus. Carers of a recently vaccinated baby should be advised of the need to wash their hands after changing the baby’s nappies.

Smallpox vaccine

Limited supplies of smallpox vaccine are held at the Specialist and Reference Microbiology Division, Public Health England Colindale (Tel. (020) 8200 4400) for the exclusive use of workers in laboratories where pox viruses (such as vaccinia) are handled.

If a wider use of the vaccine is being considered, Guidelines for smallpox response and management in the post-eradication era should be consulted at www.gov.uk/phe.

Tetanus vaccine

Tetanus vaccine contains a cell-free purified toxin of Clostridium tetani adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate to improve antigenicity.

Primary immunisation for children under 10 years consists of 3 doses of a combined preparation containing adsorbed tetanus vaccine, with an interval of 1 month between doses. Following routine childhood vaccination, 2 booster doses of a preparation containing adsorbed tetanus vaccine are recommended, the first before school entry and the second before leaving school (see Immunisation schedule).

The recommended schedule of tetanus vaccination not only gives protection against tetanus in childhood but also gives the basic immunity for subsequent booster doses. In most circumstances, a total of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine is considered sufficient for long term protection.

For primary immunisation of adults and children over 10 years previously unimmunised against tetanus, 3 doses of adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine are given with an interval of 1 month between doses (see Diphtheria-containing Vaccines).

When an individual presents for a booster dose but has been vaccinated following a tetanus-prone wound, the vaccine preparation administered at the time of injury should be determined. If this is not possible, the booster should still be given to ensure adequate protection against all antigens in the booster vaccine.

Very rarely, tetanus has developed after abdominal surgery; patients awaiting elective surgery should be asked about tetanus immunisation and immunised if necessary.

Parenteral drug abuse is also associated with tetanus; those abusing drugs by injection should be vaccinated if unimmunised—booster doses should be given if there is any doubt about their immunisation status.

All laboratory staff should be offered a primary course if unimmunised.

Wounds

Wounds are considered to be tetanus-prone if they are sustained more than 6 hours before surgical treatment or at any interval after injury and are puncture-type (particularly if contaminated with soil or manure) or show much devitalised tissue or are septic or are compound fractures or contain foreign bodies. All wounds should receive thorough cleansing.

For clean wounds: fully immunised individuals (those who have received a total of 5 doses of a tetanus-containing vaccine at appropriate intervals) and those whose primary immunisation is complete (with boosters up to date), do not require tetanus vaccine; individuals whose primary immunisation is incomplete or whose boosters are not up to date require a reinforcing dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine (followed by further doses as required to complete the schedule); non-immunised individuals (or those whose immunisation status is not known or who have been fully immunised but are now immunocompromised) should be given a dose of the appropriate tetanus-containing vaccine immediately (followed by completion of the full course of the vaccine if records confirm the need)For tetanus-prone wounds: management is as for clean wounds with the addition of a dose of tetanus immunoglobulin given at a different site; in fully immunised individuals and those whose primary immunisation is complete (with boosters up to date) the immunoglobulin is needed only if the risk of infection is especially high (e.g. contamination with manure). Antibacterial prophylaxis (with benzylpenicillin, co-amoxiclav, or metronidazole) may also be required for tetanus-prone wounds.Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine

Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, inactivated contains inactivated tick-borne encephalitis virus cultivated in chick embryo cells. It is recommended for immunisation of those working in, or visiting, high-risk areas (see International Travel). Those working, walking or camping in warm forested areas of Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Northern and Eastern China, and some parts of Japan, particularly from April to November when ticks are most prevalent, are at greatest risk of tick-borne encephalitis. For full protection, 3 doses of the vaccine are required; booster doses are required every 3–5 years for those still at risk. Ideally, immunisation should be completed at least one month before travel.

Typhoid vaccine

Typhoid vaccine is available as Vi capsular polysaccharide (from Salmonella typhi) vaccine for injection and as live attenuated Salmonella typhi for oral use.

Typhoid immunisation is advised for:

travellers to areas where typhoid is endemic, especially if staying with or visiting local people;travellers to endemic areas where frequent or prolonged exposure to poor sanitation and poor food hygiene is likelylaboratory personnel who, in the course of their work, may be exposed to Salmonella typhi.Typhoid vaccination is not a substitute for scrupulous personal hygiene.

Capsular polysaccharidetyphoid vaccine is usually given by intramuscular injection. Children under 2 years may respond suboptimally to the vaccine, but children aged between 1–2 years should be immunised if the risk of typhoid fever is considered high (immunisation is not recommended for infants under 12 months). Revaccination is needed every 3 years on continued exposure.

Oraltyphoid vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine contained in an enteric-coated capsule. One capsule taken on alternate days for a total of 3 doses, provides protection 7–10 days after the last dose. Protection may persist for up to 3 years in those constantly (or repeatedly) exposed to Salmonella typhi, but those who only occasionally travel to endemic areas require further courses at intervals of 1 year.

Varicella-zoster vaccine

The live varicella-zoster vaccine, Varilrix and Varivax, are licensed for immunisation against varicella (chickenpox) in seronegative individuals. They are not recommended for routine use in children, but can be given to seronegative healthy children over 1 year who come into close contact with individuals at high risk of severe varicella infections. The Department of Health recommends these vaccines for seronegative healthcare workers who come into direct contact with patients. Those with a history of chickenpox or shingles can be considered immune, but healthcare workers with a negative or uncertain history should be tested.

Rarely, the varicella-zoster vaccine virus has been transmitted from the vaccinated individual to close contacts. Therefore, contact with the following should be avoided if a vaccine-related cutaneous rash develops within 4–6 weeks of the first or second dose:

varicella-susceptible pregnant women;individuals at high risk of severe varicella, including those with immunodeficiency or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy;Healthcare workers who develop a generalised papular or vesicular rash on vaccination should avoid contact with patients until the lesions have crusted. Those who develop a localised rash after vaccination should cover the lesions and be allowed to continue working unless in contact with patients at high risk of severe varicella.

The high potency, live varicella-zoster vaccine, Zostavax, is recommended for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in adults who are, or were, 70 years of age on 1 September 2014. The 2014-15, catch-up programme with Zostavax will be offered to all who are, or were, 78 or 79 years of age on 1 September 2014. A single dose of Zostavax is likely to give protection for at least 7 years, but the need for, or timing of, a booster dose has not been established. Although Zostavax is not recommended for the treatment of shingles or post-herpetic neuralgia, it can be given to those with a previous history of shingles; ideally the vaccine should be delayed until systemic antiviral therapy has been completed.

Varicella-zoster immunoglobulin is used to protect susceptible individuals at increased risk of varicella infection.

Yellow fever vaccine

Yellow fever vaccine, live is indicated for those travelling or living in areas where infection is endemic and for laboratory staff who handle the virus or who handle clinical material from suspected cases. Infants under 6 months of age should not be vaccinated because there is a small risk of encephalitis; infants aged 6–9 months should be vaccinated only if the risk of yellow fever is high and unavoidable (seek expert advice). The immunity which probably lasts for life is officially accepted for 10 years starting from 10 days after primary immunisation and for a further 10 years immediately after revaccination.

      <p>
        <i>Candidal vulvitis</i> can be treated locally with cream, but is almost invariably associated with vaginal infection which should also be treated. <i>Vaginal candidiasis</i> is treated primarily with antifungal pessaries or cream inserted high into the vagina (including during menstruation). Single-dose preparations offer an advantage when compliance is a problem. Local irritation may occur on application of vaginal antifungal products.</p>

Pregnant women need a longer duration of treatment, usually about 7 days, to clear the infection. Oral antifungal treatment should be avoided during pregnancy.</p>
    </sectiondiv>
    <sectiondiv>
      <p outputclass=\"title\">Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis</p>
      <p>Recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis is particularly likely if there are predisposing factors, such as antibacterial therapy, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, or possibly oral contraceptive use. Reservoirs of infection may also lead to recontamination and should be treated; these include other skin sites such as the digits, nail beds, and umbilicus as well as the gastro-intestinal tract and the bladder. The partner may also be the source of reinfection and, if symptomatic, should be treated with a topical imidazole cream at the same time.</p>

Symptoms are often restricted to the vulva, but infections almost invariably involve the vagina which should also be treated. Applications to the vulva alone are likely to give only symptomatic relief without cure.

Aqueous medicated douches may disturb normal vaginal acidity and bacterial flora.

Topical anaesthetic agents give only symptomatic relief and may cause sensitivity reactions. They are indicated only in cases of pruritus where specific local causes have been excluded.

Systemic drugs are required in the treatment of infections such as gonorrhoea and syphilis.

Preparations for vaginal and vulval changes

Topical HRT for vaginal atrophy

A cream containing an oestrogen may be applied on a short-term basis to improve the vaginal epithelium in menopausal atrophic vaginitis. It is important to bear in mind that topical oestrogens should be used in the smallest effective amount to minimise systemic effects. Modified-release vaginal tablets and an impregnated vaginal ring are now also available.

The risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is increased when systemic oestrogens are administered alone for prolonged periods. The endometrial safety of long-term or repeated use of topical vaginal oestrogens is uncertain; treatment should be reviewed at least annually, with special consideration given to any symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.

Topical oestrogens are also used in postmenopausal women before vaginal surgery for prolapse when there is epithelial atrophy.

Non-hormonal preparations for vaginal atrophy

Several non-hormonal vaginal moisturisers are available and some are prescribable on the NHS (consult Drug Tariff).

Vaginal and vulval infections

Effective specific treatments are available for the common vaginal infections.

Fungal infections

Candidal vulvitis can be treated locally with cream, but is almost invariably associated with vaginal infection which should also be treated. Vaginal candidiasis is treated primarily with antifungal pessaries or cream inserted high into the vagina (including during menstruation). Single-dose preparations offer an advantage when compliance is a problem. Local irritation may occur on application of vaginal antifungal products.

Imidazole drugs (clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, fenticonazole nitrate, and miconazole) are effective against candida in short courses of 1 to 14 days according to the preparation used; treatment can be repeated if initial course fails to control symptoms or if symptoms recur. Vaginal applications may be supplemented with antifungal cream for vulvitis and to treat other superficial sites of infection.

Oral treatment of vaginal infection with fluconazole or itraconazole is also effective.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis in pregnancy

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is common during pregnancy and can be treated with vaginal application of an imidazole (such as clotrimazole), and a topical imidazole cream for vulvitis. Pregnant women need a longer duration of treatment, usually about 7 days, to clear the infection. Oral antifungal treatment should be avoided during pregnancy.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis

Recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis is particularly likely if there are predisposing factors, such as antibacterial therapy, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, or possibly oral contraceptive use. Reservoirs of infection may also lead to recontamination and should be treated; these include other skin sites such as the digits, nail beds, and umbilicus as well as the gastro-intestinal tract and the bladder. The partner may also be the source of reinfection and, if symptomatic, should be treated with a topical imidazole cream at the same time.

Treatment against candida may need to be extended for 6 months in recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Other infections

Trichomonal infections commonly involve the lower urinary tract as well as the genital system and need systemic treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole.

Bacterial infections with Gram-negative organisms are particularly common in association with gynaecological operations and trauma. Metronidazole is effective against certain Gram-negative organisms, especially Bacteroides spp. and can be used prophylactically in gynaecological surgery.

Clindamycin cream and metronidazole gel are indicated for bacterial vaginosis.

Vaginal preparations intended to restore normal acidity may prevent recurrence of vaginal infections and permit the re-establishment of the normal vaginal flora.

The antiviral drugs aciclovir, famciclovir, and valaciclovir can be used in the treatment of genital infection due to herpes simplex virus, the HSV type 2 being a major cause of genital ulceration; they have a beneficial effect on virus shedding and healing, generally giving relief from pain and other symptoms.

Choice of mechanical prophylaxis will depend on factors such as the type of surgery, suitability for the patient, and their condition.

Patients undergoing general or orthopaedic surgery, who are considered to be at high risk of venous thromboembolism, should be offered pharmacological prophylaxis. Choice of prophylaxis will depend on the type of surgery, suitability for the patient, and local policy. A low molecular weight heparin is suitable in all types of general and orthopaedic surgery; heparin (unfractionated) is preferred for patients in renal failure. Fondaparinux sodium is an option for patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, hip fracture surgery, gastro-intestinal, bariatric, or day surgery procedures. The oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, and rivaroxaban are indicated for thromboprophylaxis following hip or knee replacement surgery.

 Pharmacological prophylaxis in general surgery should usually continue for 5–7 days, or until sufficient mobility has been re-established. Pharmacological prophylaxis should be extended to 28 days after major cancer surgery in the abdomen or pelvis. Hip or knee replacement surgery, and hip fracture surgery, require an extended duration of pharmacological prophylaxis, depending on the preparation used (consult product literature).

General medical patients who are considered to be at high risk of venous thromboembolism should be offered pharmacological prophylaxis on admission. Choice of prophylaxis will depend on the medical condition, suitability for the patient, and local policy. Patients should receive either a low molecular weight heparin, heparin (unfractionated) (if patient in renal failure), or fondaparinux sodium. Prophylaxis should continue until the patient is no longer considered to be at significant risk of venous thromboembolism. Mechanical prophylaxis (e.g. anti-embolism stockings) can be offered to medical patients in whom pharmacological prophylaxis is contra-indicated, and continued until the patient is sufficiently mobile.

Treatment of venous thromboembolism

For the initial treatment of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism a low molecular weight heparin is used; alternatively, heparin (unfractionated)is given as an intravenous loading dose, followed by continuous intravenous infusion (using an infusion pump) or (for deep-vein thrombosis only) by intermittent subcutaneous injection. Intermittent intravenous injection of heparin (unfractionated) is no longer recommended. An oral anticoagulant (usually warfarin sodium is started at the same time as unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin (the heparin needs to be continued for at least 5 days and until the INR is ≥2 for at least 24 hours). Laboratory monitoring for heparin (unfractionated), preferably on a daily basis, is essential; determination of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is the most widely used measure (for heparin (unfractionated). A low molecular weight heparin or, in some circumstances, heparin (unfractionated) is also used in regimens for the management of myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

Management of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy

Heparins are used for the management of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy because they do not cross the placenta. Low molecular weight heparins are preferred because they have a lower risk of osteoporosis and of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Low molecular weight heparins are eliminated more rapidly in pregnancy, requiring alteration of the dosage regimen for drugs such as dalteparin sodium, enoxaparin sodium, and tinzaparin sodium. Treatment should be stopped at the onset of labour and advice sought from a specialist on continuing therapy after birth.

Extracorporeal circuits

Heparin (unfractionated) is also used in the maintenance of extracorporeal circuits in cardiopulmonary bypass and haemodialysis.

Haemorrhage

If haemorrhage occurs it is usually sufficient to withdraw unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin, but if rapid reversal of the effects of the heparin is required, protamine sulfate is a specific antidote (but only partially reverses the effects of low molecular weight heparins).

Vitamins are used for the prevention and treatment of specific deficiency states or where the diet is known to be inadequate; they may be prescribed in the NHS to prevent or treat deficiency but not as dietary supplements.

Their use as general ‘pick-me-ups’ is of unproven value and, in the case of preparations containing vitamin A or D, may actually be harmful if patients take more than the prescribed dose. The ‘fad’ for mega-vitamin therapy with water-soluble vitamins, such as ascorbic acid and pyridoxine hydrochloride, is unscientific and can be harmful.

Dietary reference values for vitamins are available in the Department of Health publication:

Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom: Report of the Panel on Dietary Reference Values of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy. Report on Health and Social Subjects 41. London: HMSO, 1991.

Dental patients

It is unjustifiable to treat stomatitis or glossitis with mixtures of vitamin preparations; this delays diagnosis and correct treatment.

Most patients who develop a nutritional deficiency despite an adequate intake of vitamins have malabsorption and if this is suspected the patient should be referred to a medical practitioner.

Vitamin A

Deficiency of vitamin A (retinol) is associated with ocular defects (particularly xerophthalmia) and an increased susceptibility to infections, but deficiency is rare in the UK (even in disorders of fat absorption).

Vitamin B group

Deficiency of the B vitamins, other than vitamin B12, is rare in the UK and is usually treated by preparations containing thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), and nicotinamide, which is used in preference to nicotinic acid, as it does not cause vasodilatation. Other members (or substances traditionally classified as members) of the vitamin B complex such as aminobenzoic acid, biotin, choline, inositol nicotinate, and pantothenic acid or panthenol may be included in vitamin B preparations but there is no evidence of their value.

The severe deficiency states Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Korsakoff’s psychosis, especially as seen in chronic alcoholism, are best treated initially by the parenteral administration of B vitamins (Pabrinex), followed by oral administration of thiamine in the longer term. Anaphylaxis has been reported with parenteral B vitamins.

As with other vitamins of the B group,pyridoxine hydrochloride (B6) deficiency is rare, but it may occur during isoniazid therapy or penicillamine treatment in Wilson’s disease and is characterised by peripheral neuritis. High doses of pyridoxine hydrochloride are given in some metabolic disorders, such as hyperoxaluria, and it is also used in sideroblastic anaemia. There is evidence to suggest that pyridoxine hydrochloride may provide some benefit in premenstrual syndrome. It has been tried for a wide variety of other disorders, but there is little sound evidence to support the claims of efficacy.

Nicotinic acid inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol and triglyceride. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are used in the treatment of megaloblastic anaemia. Folinic acid (available as calcium folinate) is used in association with cytotoxic therapy.

Vitamin C

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) therapy is essential in scurvy, but less florid manifestations of vitamin C deficiency are commonly found, especially in the elderly.

Severe scurvy causes gingival swelling and bleeding margins as well as petechiae on the skin. This is, however, exceedingly rare and a patient with these signs is more likely to have leukaemia. Investigation should not be delayed by a trial period of vitamin treatment.

Claims that vitamin C ameliorates colds or promotes wound healing have not been proven.

Vitamin D

The term Vitamin D is used for a range of compounds which possess the property of preventing or curing rickets. They include ergocalciferol (calciferol, vitamin D2), colecalciferol (vitamin D3), dihydrotachysterol, alfacalcidol (1α-hydroxycholecalciferol), and calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol).

Simple vitamin D deficiency can be prevented by taking an oral supplement of ergocalciferol (calciferol, vitamin D2) or colecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily. Vitamin D deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D. In these individuals, ergocalciferol or colecalciferol daily by mouth may be given to treat vitamin D deficiency; higher doses may be necessary for severe deficiency. Patients who do not respond should be referred to a specialist.

Preparations containing colecalciferol with calcium carbonate are available for the management of combined calcium and vitamin D deficiency, or for those at high risk of deficiency.

Vitamin D deficiency caused by intestinal malabsorption or chronic liver disease usually requires vitamin D in pharmacological doses.

Vitamin D requires hydroxylation by the kidney to its active form, therefore the hydroxylated derivatives alfacalcidol or calcitriol should be prescribed if patients with severe renal impairment require vitamin D therapy. Calcitriol is also licensed for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Paricalcitol, a synthetic vitamin D analogue, is licensed for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure.

Vitamin E

The daily requirement of vitamin E (tocopherol) has not been well defined but is probably 3 to 15 mg daily. There is little evidence that oral supplements of vitamin E are essential in adults, even where there is fat malabsorption secondary to cholestasis. In young children with congenital cholestasis, abnormally low vitamin E concentrations may be found in association with neuromuscular abnormalities, which usually respond only to the parenteral administration of vitamin E.

Vitamin E has been tried for various other conditions but there is little scientific evidence of its value.

Vitamin K

Vitamin K is necessary for the production of blood clotting factors and proteins necessary for the normal calcification of bone.

Because vitamin K is fat soluble, patients with fat malabsorption, especially in biliary obstruction or hepatic disease, may become deficient. Menadiol sodium phosphate is a water-soluble synthetic vitamin K derivative that can be given orally to prevent vitamin K deficiency in malabsorption syndromes.

Oral coumarin anticoagulants act by interfering with vitamin K metabolism in the hepatic cells and their effects can be antagonised by giving vitamin K.

Other compounds

Potassium aminobenzoate has been used in the treatment of various disorders associated with excessive fibrosis such as scleroderma and Peyronie’s disease. In Peyronie’s disease there is some evidence to support efficacy in reducing progression when given early in the disease; however, there is no evidence for reversal of the condition. The therapeutic value of potassium aminobenzoate in scleroderma is doubtful.

Warts (verrucas) are caused by a human papillomavirus, which most frequently affects the hands, feet (plantar warts), and the anogenital region; treatment usually relies on local tissue destruction. Warts may regress on their own and treatment is required only if the warts are painful, unsightly, persistent, or cause distress.

Preparations of salicylic acid, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde or silver nitrate are available for purchase by the public; they are suitable for the removal of warts on hands and feet. Salicylic acid is a useful keratolytic which may be considered first-line; it is also suitable for the removal of corns and calluses. Preparations of salicylic acid in a collodion basis are available but some patients may develop an allergy to colophony in the formulation; collodion should be avoided in children allergic to elastic adhesive plaster. Cryotherapy causes pain, swelling, and blistering, and may be no more effective than topical salicylic acid in the treatment of warts.

Anogenital warts

The treatment of anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata) should be accompanied by screening for other sexually transmitted infections. Podophyllotoxin (the major active ingredient of podophyllum) may be used for soft, non-keratinised external anogenital warts. Patients with a limited number of external warts or keratinised lesions may be better treated with cryotherapy or other forms of physical ablation.

Imiquimod cream is licensed for the treatment of external anogenital warts; it may be used for both keratinised and non-keratinised lesions. It is also licensed for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis.

Inosine pranobex is licensed for adjunctive treatment of genital warts but it has been superseded by more effective drugs.
